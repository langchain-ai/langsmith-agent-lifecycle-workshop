## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Position Speakers:** Place the speakers on your desk about 2-3 feet apart, with one on each side of your monitor. The left speaker has the USB cable attached, the right speaker connects to the left via the speaker cable. Position them at or slightly below ear level for best sound, angled toward your seating position.

2. **Connect Speakers Together:** The right speaker has a 3.5mm cable attached. Plug this cable into the jack on the back of the left speaker. The cable is about 3.5 feet long, which determines maximum speaker spacing.

3. **Connect USB to Computer:** Plug the USB connector from the left speaker into an available USB port on your computer. The speakers power on automatically—no power button or batteries needed. A small LED on the left speaker indicates power.

4. **Select Audio Output Device:** On Mac, go to System Settings > Sound > Output and select "Logitech USB Speakers." On Windows, right-click the speaker icon in the taskbar > Sound settings > Output device > select "Logitech USB Speakers." Your computer now routes all audio through the speakers.

5. **Adjust Volume:** Use the inline volume dial on the USB cable to control speaker volume. This provides quick access without reaching for computer volume controls. You can also adjust volume using your computer's volume controls or keyboard media keys.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why USB instead of 3.5mm audio jack speakers?**

A: USB speakers have several advantages. First, they bypass your computer's internal sound card, which can have electrical noise or poor quality DAC (digital-to-analog converter). USB provides a digital signal that's converted inside the speakers, often resulting in cleaner audio. Second, USB provides power, so you don't need a wall outlet or batteries—simplifies cable management. Third, modern laptops often have mediocre headphone jacks, so USB can provide better audio quality. The tradeoff is you can't use these with phones or devices without USB ports.

**Q: Can I use these with my MacBook Air (USB-C only)?**

A: Yes, but you'll need a USB-C to USB-A adapter (sold separately for $15-25). We carry these adapters, or you can use any quality USB-C hub with USB-A ports. Simply plug the speakers' USB-A connector into the adapter/hub, then connect that to your MacBook's USB-C port. The speakers work perfectly via adapters—USB is USB regardless of the physical connector type. Many users with newer MacBooks use a USB-C hub on their desk for multiple peripherals.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: These Logitech speakers include Logitech's 1-year limited hardware warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This covers driver failures, USB connectivity issues, and volume control malfunctions. Physical damage from drops or spills is not covered. For warranty service, contact Logitech Support at 1-877-775-6442 or visit support.logitech.com with your proof of purchase.

**Q: Can I return these after opening them?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The speakers must be in good condition with the attached cables undamaged. Since these speakers are under $500 ($79), there is no restocking fee for returns. Audio quality preferences are personal, so we provide the 14-day window to test them with your typical audio content (music, calls, etc.).

**Q: How do these compare to laptop or monitor speakers?**

A: These speakers are a significant upgrade from built-in laptop speakers or most monitor speakers. Laptop speakers are tiny and face downward, resulting in thin, quiet sound. These dedicated speakers have larger 2-inch drivers that produce fuller bass and clearer mids/highs. The stereo separation (speakers 2-3 feet apart) creates proper left-right imaging that's impossible with laptop speakers. For basic audio needs, the improvement is dramatic. However, if you're an audiophile or want deep bass, you'd need larger bookshelf speakers or a system with a subwoofer.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: No sound or computer not recognizing speakers**

Solution: Check that the USB connector is fully inserted into your computer. Try a different USB port—preferably one directly on your computer rather than a USB hub. Some USB ports don't provide sufficient power. On Mac, go to System Settings > Sound > Output and manually select "Logitech USB Speakers." On Windows, right-click speaker icon > Sound settings > Output and select the Logitech speakers. Ensure the inline volume dial isn't turned all the way down to zero. Check that the speaker-to-speaker cable is firmly connected between left and right speakers. Restart your computer with the speakers connected. If using a USB hub, try a powered USB hub that provides more consistent power to devices.

**Issue: Sound is distorted, crackling, or cutting out**

Solution: Distortion usually indicates volume is too high. Lower the inline volume dial on the speakers and increase your computer's volume instead—this provides cleaner amplification. If using a USB hub, try connecting directly to computer—hubs can cause power fluctuations. Check that the USB port is clean and making good contact. Try a different USB port on your computer. Update your computer's operating system and USB drivers. In Windows, right-click speaker icon > Sound settings > Advanced sound options > App volume and device preferences—ensure the speakers are set to 100% volume there. Crackling can be caused by electrical interference from nearby devices—move the speakers away from power adapters, routers, or other electronics.

**Issue: Volume too low even at maximum or lacking bass**

Solution: Maximize the inline volume dial on the speakers, then adjust your computer's volume to a comfortable level. Check your computer's audio settings for any volume limits or sound enhancements—on Windows, right-click speaker icon > Sounds > Playback > Properties > Advanced—disable any "Enable audio enhancements." On Mac, check Sound settings for output volume. These are compact desktop speakers with 2-inch drivers—they have limited bass response (80 Hz lower limit). If you need more bass or louder volume, you'd need larger speakers or a system with a subwoofer. For their size and price point, these provide good sound for desktop use, but aren't designed for room-filling audio or heavy bass. Position speakers closer to walls or corners to slightly increase bass perception through boundary reinforcement.
