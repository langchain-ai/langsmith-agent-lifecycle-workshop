## What's Included

- 7-in-1 USB-C Hub with attached cable
- User manual

Note: HDMI cable, USB-C power adapter, and peripherals sold separately.

## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Connect Hub to Laptop:** Plug the hub's USB-C connector into your laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port. The blue LED illuminates when connected and powered. No drivers needed—works immediately (plug-and-play).

2. **Connect Display (Optional):** If using an external monitor, connect an HDMI cable from the hub's HDMI port to your monitor. On Mac, go to System Settings > Displays to arrange displays. On Windows, press Windows + P to select display mode (Extend or Duplicate).

3. **Connect Power for Charging:** Plug your laptop's USB-C power adapter into the hub's USB-C PD port. The laptop charges while using the hub. This allows the USB-C connection to provide both expansion and charging simultaneously.

4. **Connect Peripherals:** Plug USB devices (keyboard, mouse, external drive) into the three USB-A ports. Insert SD or microSD cards into the respective card readers. The computer recognizes devices automatically.

5. **Verify Function:** Check that all connected devices work. If a specific port doesn't respond, try reconnecting the hub to the laptop. Some laptops require displays to be connected before the hub for proper detection. Restart if needed.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this work with my MacBook Air M2?**

A: Yes! This hub is perfect for MacBook Airs and Pros with limited ports. It connects to your MacBook's USB-C port and instantly gives you HDMI output for monitors, USB-A ports for your existing peripherals, and card readers—all while passing through charging. It's essentially the hub Apple should have included. Just remember to plug your MacBook charger into the hub's PD port so you don't lose your charging capability.

**Q: Can I charge my laptop while using all the ports?**

A: Yes, but understand how Power Delivery passthrough works. If you connect an 87W charger to the hub, the hub consumes about 15W for its operation, leaving 72W for your laptop. This is fine for most uses. However, during intensive tasks (video rendering, gaming), your laptop may discharge slowly if you're using a lower-wattage charger. Use your laptop's original charger for best results. The hub prioritizes power to your laptop first, then to connected USB devices.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This USB-C hub includes a 1-year limited manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This covers port failures, HDMI connectivity issues, and Power Delivery problems. Physical damage from drops or liquid damage is not covered. For warranty service, contact us with your proof of purchase and we'll coordinate replacement or repair.

**Q: Can I return this if opened?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The hub must be in good condition with all packaging. Since this hub is under $500 ($49), there is no restocking fee for returns. Hub compatibility can be tricky with some laptops, so we provide the 14-day window to ensure it works with your specific laptop and peripherals.

**Q: Why does 4K video look laggy or choppy?**

A: This hub supports 4K @ 60Hz, but achieving smooth 4K requires sufficient USB-C bandwidth. If you're also transferring large files via USB-A ports or card readers simultaneously, bandwidth is shared and video may stutter. For smoothest 4K video, minimize simultaneous data transfers. Also ensure you're using a high-quality HDMI cable (HDMI 2.0 certified). Some older laptops' USB-C ports don't support 4K @ 60Hz—they max out at 4K @ 30Hz. Check your laptop specifications. If 30Hz is all you get, it's your laptop's limitation, not the hub.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: HDMI display not detected or no video output**

Solution: First, ensure your laptop's USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alt Mode (video output)—not all USB-C ports do. Try connecting the display directly to the laptop (with an adapter) to confirm video capability. Disconnect and reconnect the hub from the laptop. Connect the display BEFORE connecting other USB devices—some laptops prioritize video detection during initial connection. Try a different USB-C port on your laptop if you have multiple. On Mac, hold Option and click the Displays icon in System Settings to click "Detect Displays." On Windows, press Windows + P and ensure you're in Extend or Duplicate mode, not "PC screen only." Try a different HDMI cable—faulty cables cause most display issues. Update your laptop's operating system, as updates often improve USB-C video compatibility.

**Issue: USB devices not working or not recognized**

Solution: Check that the hub is getting sufficient power—connect your laptop's charger to the hub's PD port. USB devices require power, and without the PD connection, the hub may not provide enough. Try connecting fewer devices at once to test if it's a bandwidth or power issue. Some high-powered USB devices (external hard drives) may need their own power adapters. Unplug and replug the specific USB device. Try the device in a different USB port on the hub. Verify the device works by connecting it directly to your laptop—the device itself may be faulty. On Windows, check Device Manager for any yellow warning icons. Update USB drivers if available. Some laptops limit USB-C hub functionality through BIOS—check for firmware updates.

**Issue: Laptop charging slowly or not charging at all through hub**

Solution: Verify you're using your laptop's original power adapter or one with equivalent wattage. Low-wattage adapters can't charge laptops effectively through hubs. Ensure the charger is connected to the hub's USB-C PD port (the one marked for power input), not a data-only USB-C port. Check that the charger's cable is fully inserted at both ends. Some laptops display "slow charging" warnings when using passthrough—this is normal if your charger's wattage minus the hub's 15W consumption is less than your laptop's standard charging rate. If the laptop doesn't charge at all, try connecting the charger directly to the laptop to verify the charger works. The hub's PD port may be faulty if the charger works directly but not through the hub—contact warranty support.
