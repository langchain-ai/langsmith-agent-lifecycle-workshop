## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Unbox and Inspect:** Remove the stand from packaging and ensure all silicone pads are attached (two on the front lip, two on the back support). Check that adjustment mechanisms move smoothly.

2. **Position on Desk:** Place the stand on your desk where you want your laptop. The wide base should sit flat with all four rubber feet touching the desk surface. Position it so the cable management channel on the back aligns with your cable routing needs.

3. **Adjust Height and Angle:** Before placing your laptop, set the desired height by adjusting the support arms to one of the six height positions. Start with the middle height (around 4") and adjust based on your sitting position and external monitor height. The stand locks into position with a firm press.

4. **Place Laptop on Stand:** Carefully place your laptop on the stand with the bottom edge resting against the front lip (the silicone pads). The laptop back should rest against the raised support. Ensure the laptop sits securely and doesn't wobble.

5. **Route Cables:** Thread your power cable, USB-C hub cables, and peripheral cables through the cable management channel on the back of the stand. This keeps your desk tidy and prevents cables from pulling on your laptop. For best ergonomics, use an external keyboard and mouse with the stand.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this fit my 16-inch MacBook Pro?**

A: Yes! This stand accommodates laptops from 10" to 17", so your 16-inch MacBook Pro fits perfectly. The stand supports up to 22 lbs, much more than the MacBook Pro's weight (~4.8 lbs). The aluminum finish matches the MacBook aesthetic, and the silicone pads protect the aluminum laptop body from scratches. Many MacBook Pro users choose this exact stand for this reason.

**Q: Can I use my laptop's built-in keyboard while it's on the stand?**

A: Technically yes, but it's not ideal ergonomically. When elevated, typing on the laptop's keyboard requires reaching upward, which can strain your wrists and shoulders. The purpose of elevating your laptop is to bring the screen to eye level, which means using an external keyboard and mouse at normal desk height. This creates a proper ergonomic setup where your eyes, neck, and wrists are all in comfortable positions. We recommend pairing this stand with any of our wireless keyboards and mice for the best experience.

**Q: Does this really improve laptop cooling?**

A: Yes! Laptops typically sit flat on desks, blocking ventilation from the bottom vents. This stand elevates the laptop with an open design that allows air to flow freely underneath and through the large ventilation cutout. This passive cooling is especially noticeable during intensive tasks like video editing, gaming, or compiling code. Users report lower fan noise and cooler laptop surfaces. While it's not as effective as a laptop cooling pad with active fans, the improved airflow does make a meaningful difference for thermal performance.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This laptop stand includes a 1-year limited manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This covers structural failures, finish defects, and adjustment mechanism problems. Physical damage from drops or misuse is not covered. Given the simple, solid aluminum construction, these stands typically last many years without issues. For warranty service, contact us with your proof of purchase.

**Q: Can I return this if opened?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics and accessories within 14 days of delivery. The stand must be in good condition with all silicone pads intact. Since this stand is under $500 ($45), there is no restocking fee for returns. Ergonomics and fit preferences vary, so we provide the 14-day window to test it with your actual laptop and desk setup.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Laptop wobbles or feels unstable on stand**

Solution: First, ensure the stand is on a flat, level surface—uneven desks cause wobbling. Check that all four rubber feet on the base are touching the desk. Verify that the height adjustment mechanism is fully locked into one of the six positions (you should hear/feel a click). Ensure the laptop is positioned correctly with the bottom edge against the front lip silicone pads. If your laptop has a curved bottom (some gaming laptops), it may not sit as securely—try a different angle adjustment. Check that the silicone pads are clean and not covered in dust, which reduces grip. If the stand itself wobbles, tighten any adjustment screws that may have loosened during shipping (check under the base).

**Issue: Stand doesn't stay at desired height or angle**

Solution: The adjustment mechanism may not be fully engaged. Lift the laptop off the stand, then firmly press down on the support arms while adjusting to the desired height—the mechanism should click into place at one of the six positions. Don't try to use in-between heights; use only the preset positions. If the stand keeps collapsing or won't hold position, check for an adjustment screw or knob that controls tension (location varies by model—check manual). If the adjustment is too stiff, you may need to loosen a tension screw slightly. If too loose and won't hold position, tighten it. If no adjustment mechanism exists and it still won't hold, this may be a warranty defect—contact support.

**Issue: Laptop sliding forward off the stand**

Solution: Ensure the front lip's silicone pads are present and making contact with the laptop bottom—these pads provide grip. Clean both the laptop's bottom surface and the silicone pads with a slightly damp cloth to remove oils and dust that reduce friction. Adjust the stand to a less steep angle if currently set at a very steep angle—gravity pulls the laptop forward on steep angles. Some very lightweight tablets or thin laptops may need the back support raised higher relative to the front. For extremely slippery laptops (some plastic-bottomed models), you can add additional silicone grip tape (sold at hardware stores) to the contact points. The stand is designed for laptops, not tablets—tablets may be too light and smooth for reliable grip.
