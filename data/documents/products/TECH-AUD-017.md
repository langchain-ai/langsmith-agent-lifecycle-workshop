## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Check Ear Tip Fit:** Try the different silicone tips (XS, S, M, L) to find the best seal. A proper seal is critical for sound quality and ANC performance. On iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth > AirPods Pro > Ear Tip Fit Test to verify you have the right size.

2. **Pair with iPhone/iPad:** With AirPods in the charging case, open the lid near your unlocked iPhone. An animation appears on screen—tap "Connect." The AirPods automatically pair with all devices signed into your iCloud account. For other Apple devices, they'll appear in Bluetooth settings.

3. **Pair with Non-Apple Devices:** Press and hold the button on the back of the case until the status light flashes white (pairing mode). On your Android phone or Windows PC, go to Bluetooth settings and select "AirPods Pro" from the available devices.

4. **Learn Touch Controls:** Lightly press the force sensor (indented area) on the stem once to play/pause or answer/end calls. Press twice to skip forward, three times to skip back. Press and hold to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. Ask "Hey Siri" for voice control on Apple devices.

5. **Customize Settings (iPhone):** Go to Settings > Bluetooth > tap the "i" next to AirPods Pro. Here you can customize press-and-hold actions, enable/disable Spatial Audio, adjust microphone settings, and more. Enable "Conversation Awareness" to automatically lower volume when you start speaking.

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between ANC and Transparency mode?**

A: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) uses microphones and computational audio to actively cancel out environmental noise—perfect for focusing on work, sleeping on flights, or blocking out distractions. Transparency mode lets outside sound in so you can hear your surroundings while still enjoying music—great for walking on streets, having brief conversations, or staying aware in public spaces. Adaptive Transparency (new in 2nd gen) automatically reduces loud environmental noises like construction or sirens while maintaining awareness. You can press and hold the stem to switch between modes instantly.

**Q: Will these work with my Android phone?**

A: Technically yes, but you'll lose most of the features that make AirPods Pro special. They'll connect via Bluetooth and you can play music and take calls, but you lose automatic pairing, automatic device switching, Spatial Audio, Adaptive EQ, Find My integration, and Siri. The touch controls work for basic functions. If you primarily use Android, the Sony WH-1000XM5 or other universal earbuds provide a much better experience. AirPods Pro are really designed for Apple users who own multiple Apple devices.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: These AirPods Pro include Apple's standard 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects and hardware failures. This includes battery issues, ANC problems, and audio defects. Physical damage from drops, water damage beyond IPX4 rating, and lost earbuds are not covered. You can purchase AppleCare+ for Headphones ($29 for 2 years) which extends coverage and adds accidental damage protection with a $29 service fee per incident. For warranty service, contact Apple at 1-800-MY-APPLE or visit an Apple Store.

**Q: Can I return these if I've opened them?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The AirPods Pro must be in good condition with all ear tips, charging case, and cable. Since these are priced under $500 ($249), there is no restocking fee for returns. Fit and comfort are personal, so we encourage you to use the 14-day window to test them with your devices and ensure they meet your needs.

**Q: How does battery life work with the case?**

A: The earbuds provide up to 6 hours of listening time with ANC on (7 hours with ANC off). The charging case holds multiple charges for up to 30 hours total listening time. When earbuds are low, place them in the case for 5 minutes to get about 1 hour of listening time (quick charge). The case charges via USB-C cable, MagSafe wireless charger, or any Qi wireless charging pad. Check battery levels on your iPhone by opening the case nearby, or ask Siri "What's the battery level of my AirPods?"

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: One earbud not working or connection issues**

Solution: Place both AirPods in the case for 30 seconds, then try again. If one earbud still doesn't work, check that it's clean—wax or debris in the speaker mesh blocks sound. Gently clean the mesh with a soft, dry brush. If the issue persists, reset the AirPods: Put them in the case, close the lid, wait 30 seconds. Open the lid, then press and hold the button on the back of the case for 15 seconds until the status light flashes amber, then white. Re-pair with your iPhone. If one earbud consistently has lower volume, check Settings > Accessibility > Audio/Visual and ensure the balance slider is centered.

**Issue: Noise cancellation not effective or hearing crackling sounds**

Solution: Ensure you have the correct ear tip size—poor seal dramatically reduces ANC effectiveness. Run the Ear Tip Fit Test on iPhone (Settings > Bluetooth > AirPods Pro > Ear Tip Fit Test). Try a different size if you don't get a "Good Seal" result. Clean the ear tips and mesh with a soft, dry cloth—wax buildup affects ANC. Some users hear crackling when ANC is on, especially when moving jaw or walking—this was addressed in a firmware update. Update firmware by placing AirPods in the case (plugged in, near iPhone) overnight—updates install automatically. If crackling persists, it may be a hardware issue covered by Apple's service program.

**Issue: Poor call quality or people can't hear me clearly**

Solution: Check that the microphone isn't blocked by debris—clean the microphone holes on the stem with a soft brush. In windy conditions, cup your hand around the AirPods while talking to reduce wind noise. In Settings > Bluetooth > AirPods Pro, check "Microphone" setting—it should be "Automatically Switch AirPods" or set to a specific side. If people hear echo or their own voice, it may be acoustic feedback—ensure your device volume isn't too loud. Try enabling "Wide Spectrum" microphone mode for noisy environments or "Voice Isolation" for clearer calls (these options appear during calls on iPhone). If problems persist, test both earbuds individually to identify if one microphone is faulty.
