## Common Questions

**Q: Can I upgrade the RAM or storage?**

A: No, the RAM is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be upgraded. The 16GB included is sufficient for most users including multitasking, web browsing, office work, and light creative tasks. The SSD is also not user-upgradeable. Consider your storage needs carefully at purchase—for most users, 512GB is adequate, but if you store large files locally, consider our 1TB configuration.

**Q: Will this work with my existing monitor and accessories?**

A: Yes! The XPS 13 works with any monitor via USB-C, HDMI (adapter required), or DisplayPort. It has three USB-C ports (two Thunderbolt 4, one USB-C 3.2), so you can connect monitors and accessories while charging. For HDMI monitors, we recommend our USB-C to HDMI adapters ($15-25) or a USB-C hub with multiple ports ($49) for maximum versatility.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This XPS 13 includes Dell's 1-year limited hardware warranty covering manufacturing defects. You also receive 1 year of mail-in service. Dell offers extended warranty options including Premium Support Plus with accidental damage protection, which can be purchased at checkout or within 30 days. Contact Dell support at 1-800-624-9896 for warranty service.

**Q: Can I return this if I've opened it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The laptop must be in good condition with all accessories. Since the XPS 13 is priced over $500, there's a 15% restocking fee for non-defective returns. If the product is defective or we made an error, there's no restocking fee and we'll cover return shipping.

**Q: Does this come with Microsoft Office?**

A: This XPS 13 includes a 30-day trial of Microsoft 365 Personal, which gives you access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage. After the trial, you can purchase a Microsoft 365 subscription (starting at $69.99/year) or buy standalone Office licenses. Windows 11 also includes free web versions of Office apps through your Microsoft account.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Battery draining quickly**

Solution: Check battery usage in Settings > System > Power & battery to identify power-hungry apps. Close unnecessary applications running in the background. Reduce screen brightness to 50-70%—the bright display is a major power consumer. Switch to "Balanced" or "Power saver" power mode in Settings. Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not needed. Windows updates and background tasks like OneDrive syncing can temporarily increase power use. Battery life varies significantly based on usage: web browsing gets ~12 hours, while video streaming or intensive apps use more power.

**Issue: USB-C device not recognized**

Solution: Try a different USB-C port—the XPS 13 has three ports with different capabilities. Ensure the device is compatible with USB-C (some older devices need USB-A adapters). Check if the device needs external power—not all USB-C ports provide the same power output. Update drivers through Windows Update (Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates). If using a USB-C hub, ensure it's compatible with Thunderbolt 4 and try connecting the device directly to the laptop to test. Restart the laptop with the device connected.

**Issue: Laptop running hot or fans loud**

Solution: Ensure the laptop is on a hard, flat surface—soft surfaces like beds block air vents on the bottom. The XPS 13 uses the bottom panel for cooling. Check Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) to see which apps are using high CPU—close unnecessary programs. Windows updates installing in the background can cause temporary high CPU usage. Run Dell SupportAssist (pre-installed) to check for thermal issues or BIOS updates that may improve fan management. If the laptop runs hot during normal use, check that vents aren't blocked by dust—compressed air can clean vents. The laptop will automatically throttle performance to prevent overheating.
