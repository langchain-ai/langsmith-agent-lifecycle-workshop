## Common Questions

**Q: Can I upgrade the RAM or storage after purchase?**

A: No, the memory and storage are integrated into the M2 chip and soldered to the logic board, so they cannot be upgraded after purchase. We recommend carefully considering your needs when ordering. For most users, 8GB RAM and 256GB storage is sufficient for web browsing, office work, and light creative tasks. Power users may want to consider upgrading at purchase.

**Q: Will this work with my Dell/HP/Samsung monitor?**

A: Yes! The MacBook Air works with any monitor that has HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C input. For HDMI monitors, you'll need a USB-C to HDMI adapter (we carry these for $15-25). For USB-C monitors, you can connect directly. The MacBook Air supports one external display up to 6K resolution.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This MacBook includes Apple's standard 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects and hardware failures. You also receive 90 days of complimentary technical support. AppleCare+ is available for purchase within 60 days of your purchase date, extending coverage to 3 years and adding accidental damage protection.

**Q: Can I return this if I've opened it?**

A: Yes! We accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The MacBook should be in good condition with all original accessories included. Orders over $500 have a 15% restocking fee for non-defective returns. Defective items can be returned with no restocking fee.

**Q: Does this come with Microsoft Office or other software?**

A: The MacBook comes with Apple's free productivity suite pre-installed: Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote (presentations). These can open and export Microsoft Office files. Microsoft Office 365 is available as a separate subscription if you prefer Office apps.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: MacBook won't turn on**

Solution: Press and hold the Touch ID button (power button) for 10 seconds, release it, then press it again briefly. If it still doesn't turn on, connect the power adapter and let it charge for at least 15 minutes—the battery may be fully depleted. The charging cable's LED should glow amber when charging. If there's still no response after 30 minutes of charging, contact Apple Support.

**Issue: External monitor not detected**

Solution: First, ensure all cables are firmly connected at both ends. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the cable. If using an adapter, make sure it's seated properly and try a different USB-C port on the MacBook. Check that the monitor is powered on and set to the correct input source (HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C). Restart your MacBook with the monitor connected. Still not working? Go to System Settings > Displays and click "Detect Displays."

**Issue: Battery draining faster than expected**

Solution: Check Activity Monitor (Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor) and click the Energy tab to identify power-hungry applications. Close apps you're not using. Reduce screen brightness to 50-75%. Disable Bluetooth if you're not using wireless accessories. Ensure macOS is up to date (System Settings > General > Software Update) as updates often include power management improvements. Note that battery life varies based on usage—video streaming and intensive apps use more power than web browsing or document editing. Background processes like photo syncing or backups can temporarily increase power usage.
