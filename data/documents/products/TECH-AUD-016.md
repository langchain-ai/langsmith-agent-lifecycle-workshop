## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Charge Headphones:** Before first use, connect the USB-C cable to charge. The indicator light shows charging status (amber while charging, green when full). A full charge takes 3.5 hours and provides 30 hours of use.

2. **Power On and Enter Pairing Mode:** Press and hold the power button for about 7 seconds until you hear "Bluetooth pairing" and the indicator flashes blue. On subsequent uses, a short press turns them on and they auto-connect to the last paired device.

3. **Pair with Device:** On your phone/computer, go to Bluetooth settings and select "WH-1000XM5" from the available devices list. Once connected, you'll hear "Bluetooth connected" and the indicator turns blue.

4. **Install Sony Headphones Connect App (Recommended):** Download the app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). The app provides firmware updates, EQ customization, ANC level adjustment, and multipoint connection management.

5. **Learn Touch Controls:** The right earcup has touch-sensitive controls. Tap once to play/pause, double-tap to skip forward, triple-tap to skip back. Swipe up/down for volume, swipe forward/back to change tracks. Cover the right earcup with your hand to quickly lower volume (Quick Attention mode).

## Common Questions

**Q: How does the noise cancellation compare to other headphones?**

A: The WH-1000XM5 offers industry-leading ANC that rivals or exceeds competitors like Bose QuietComfort and AirPods Max. Eight microphones constantly analyze ambient sound, and the HD Noise Cancelling Processor adjusts cancellation 700 times per second. It excels at blocking low-frequency rumble (airplane engines, traffic) and does well with mid-frequency noise (conversations, office sounds). For the absolute best ANC performance, use the Sony app to run the "NC Optimizer" which analyzes your ear shape and fit for personalized noise cancellation.

**Q: Can I use these with my iPhone and MacBook simultaneously?**

A: Yes! The WH-1000XM5 supports multipoint connection to two devices at once. Connect to both your iPhone and MacBook via Bluetooth (enable multipoint in the Sony app). When a call comes in on your iPhone while listening to music on your MacBook, the headphones automatically switch. You can seamlessly move between devices without manual reconnection. This is perfect for people who work across multiple devices throughout the day.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: These Sony headphones include Sony's 1-year limited manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This covers battery issues, Bluetooth connectivity problems, ANC malfunctions, and driver failures. The warranty does not cover physical damage from drops or water exposure (these headphones are not waterproof). For warranty service, contact Sony at 1-800-538-7550 or visit sony.com/electronics/support. Keep your proof of purchase.

**Q: Can I return these if I've opened them?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The headphones must be in good condition with all accessories (cables, case, airplane adapter). Since these are priced over $500 at $399... actually, let me correct that—at $399, they're under our $500 threshold, so there's **no restocking fee** for returns. This gives you two weeks to test the ANC, comfort, and sound quality in your real-world environment.

**Q: How long does the battery really last?**

A: Sony's 30-hour battery life rating (with ANC on) is accurate for moderate volume levels. At max volume with ANC on, expect 20-25 hours. With ANC off, you can get up to 40 hours. The Quick Charge feature is incredibly useful—just 3 minutes of charging gives you 3 hours of playback when you're in a rush. After 1-2 years, lithium-ion batteries naturally degrade and hold less charge, but the headphones maintain excellent battery performance throughout their lifespan.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Noise cancellation not working effectively or hearing white noise**

Solution: First, ensure the headphones fit properly—ANC effectiveness depends on good seal around your ears. Adjust the headband and rotate the earcups for optimal fit. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, run "NC Optimizer" which calibrates ANC for your specific ear shape and current atmospheric pressure (useful after flights). Try different ANC levels in the app—sometimes "Ambient Sound Control" is accidentally enabled which lets outside sound in. If you hear wind noise while walking, enable "Wind Noise Reduction" in the app. Reset the headphones by holding the power and custom buttons simultaneously for 7 seconds. If ANC still underperforms, check for firmware updates in the app.

**Issue: Won't connect to device or connection keeps dropping**

Solution: Ensure the headphones are charged—low battery causes connectivity issues. Forget/remove the headphones from your device's Bluetooth list and repair from scratch. Turn off Bluetooth on devices you're not currently using (if multiple devices are paired). Bluetooth range is about 30 feet with clear line of sight—walls and obstacles reduce range. If multipoint is enabled but causing issues, disable it in the Sony app and connect to only one device. Check for interference from Wi-Fi routers, microwaves, or other Bluetooth devices. Update headphone firmware via the Sony app. Reset headphones: with headphones on, hold power and custom buttons for 7 seconds until the indicator flashes blue 4 times.

**Issue: Touch controls not responding or triggering accidentally**

Solution: Clean the touch panel on the right earcup with a soft, dry cloth—dirt, moisture, or skin oils affect touch sensitivity. If wearing gloves or in very cold weather, touch controls may not work well. Ensure you're using deliberate gestures—light, quick taps for play/pause, firm swipes for volume/track changes. In the Sony app, you can disable specific touch controls if they trigger accidentally, or disable touch controls entirely (use physical buttons on the headphones instead). If wearing a beanie or hood that touches the earcup, it may trigger controls—adjust your clothing. Touch controls work best with clean, dry fingers on the smooth earcup surface.
