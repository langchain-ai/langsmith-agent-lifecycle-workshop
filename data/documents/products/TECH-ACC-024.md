Note: Laptop, accessories, and carrying bag sold separately.

## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Verify Fit Before Regular Use:** Before relying on this sleeve, test that your laptop fits properly. Slide your laptop into the main compartment with the screen facing the fleece-lined side (typically the side without the pocket). The laptop should slide in smoothly with slight resistance from the padding. If it's too tight or you have to force it, you may need the larger size.

2. **Position Laptop Correctly:** Always insert the laptop with the hinge/thick edge going in first, screen side facing the softer fleece lining. This protects the screen (the most vulnerable part) with the softest interior surface. The laptop should sit flat in the sleeve with even padding on all sides.

3. **Use Front Pocket for Accessories:** Store your laptop charger, USB-C cables, mouse, and other accessories in the front zippered pocket. Avoid storing heavy or sharp objects that could press against the laptop. Keep the weight balanced—don't overstuff the pocket as it can create pressure points against the laptop.

4. **Close Zipper Completely:** Always fully close the zipper before moving the sleeve. The dual zipper pulls should meet at the side. A partially open zipper can allow the laptop to slide out or expose it to moisture and damage.

5. **Insert Into Bag:** When placing the sleeve into a backpack or briefcase, position it vertically (standing up) rather than horizontally when possible. This distributes weight better and provides more protection. Keep the laptop compartment separate from heavy items like books or water bottles.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will my MacBook Pro 16" fit in the 15-inch sleeve?**

A: Yes, but just barely. The MacBook Pro 16" measures approximately 14" x 9.8" x 0.66", and the 15-inch sleeve's internal dimensions are 15" x 10.5" x 1". It fits with minimal extra room, which actually provides snug protection. However, if you use a hard-shell case on your MacBook Pro 16", it likely won't fit—you'd need to remove the case. For MacBook Pro 16" with a case, consider a dedicated 16" sleeve from a different product line.

**Q: Is this actually waterproof?**

A: No, it's water-resistant, not waterproof—there's an important difference. The polyester exterior has a water-repellent PU coating that protects against light rain, accidental spills, and splashes. If you spill coffee near the sleeve or get caught in light rain for a few minutes, your laptop stays dry. However, it's not submersible and won't protect against heavy rain for extended periods or full immersion in water. The zipper is not waterproof either. Think of it as protection for everyday scenarios, not extreme weather. Don't deliberately expose it to heavy water.

**Q: Can I use this as my only laptop bag?**

A: This is a sleeve, not a bag—it doesn't have carrying handles or a shoulder strap. It's designed to provide a protective layer inside your backpack, messenger bag, or briefcase. Some people do carry it by itself for very short distances (like from a car to an office), but it's not comfortable for extended carrying. If you need a standalone carrying solution, consider a laptop bag with handles and straps. If you're looking for lightweight protection inside an existing bag, this sleeve is perfect.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This laptop sleeve includes a 1-year limited manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This includes zipper failures, stitching defects, and padding degradation under normal use. Physical damage from misuse, cuts, tears from sharp objects, or normal wear (discoloration, minor abrasions) are not covered. For warranty claims, contact us with your proof of purchase and photos of the defect.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened accessories within 14 days of delivery. The sleeve must be in good condition, unused without stains or odors, with original packaging. Since this sleeve is under $500 ($29), there is no restocking fee for returns. Fit can be tricky with laptop sleeves, so we provide the 14-day window to ensure it fits your laptop and meets your protection needs.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Laptop doesn't fit or is too tight**

Solution: Verify you purchased the correct size for your laptop's screen size. Measure your laptop's dimensions including any case or skin you have on it—cases add thickness that affect fit. For laptops on the border between sizes (like 14" models), you might need the larger 15-inch sleeve. Try inserting the laptop from different angles—hinge first, with the screen side against the fleece lining. If the laptop absolutely won't fit without forcing, you likely need the next size up. Never force a laptop into a too-small sleeve as this can damage both the laptop and the sleeve, and puts stress on the zipper. If you purchased the wrong size, use our 14-day return window to exchange for the correct size.

**Issue: Zipper stuck, broken, or difficult to close**

Solution: If the zipper is stuck, check if fabric from the sleeve lining is caught in the zipper teeth—gently pull the fabric out while slightly opening the zipper. Ensure nothing inside the sleeve (like cables or charger) is pressing against the zipper from the inside. For a difficult zipper, run a graphite pencil along the zipper teeth to lubricate them—this often smooths operation. Never force a stuck zipper as this can break the teeth or slider. If the zipper completely fails (slider comes off track, teeth separate), this is typically a manufacturing defect covered by warranty. YKK zippers are high quality and rarely fail under normal use. For warranty service, contact us with photos of the zipper issue.

**Issue: Water got inside despite water-resistant coating**

Solution: Water-resistant doesn't mean waterproof. The coating protects against light moisture, not heavy or prolonged exposure. If water got inside, likely scenarios: (1) prolonged exposure to heavy rain, (2) water entered through the partially open zipper, or (3) water pooled on the sleeve and eventually soaked through. For future protection, always fully close the zipper, don't leave the sleeve sitting in water or rain, and if caught in heavy rain, protect the sleeve inside a waterproof bag or under your coat. If you frequently need waterproof protection, consider a hard-shell laptop case instead. Clean and dry the sleeve thoroughly after water exposure—open completely, wipe interior, and air dry for 24 hours before using again.
