## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Choose Connection Method:** Turn on the mouse using the power switch on the bottom. For wireless Bluetooth connection, press and hold the device selection button (bottom of mouse) with channel 1, 2, or 3 for 3 seconds until LED blinks. Alternatively, plug in the Bolt USB receiver to your computer for instant connection without pairing.

2. **Pair via Bluetooth:** On your computer, open Bluetooth settings (System Settings > Bluetooth on Mac, Settings > Bluetooth on Windows). Look for "MX Master 3S" in available devices and click Connect/Pair. The LED on the mouse stops blinking when successfully connected.

3. **Add Additional Devices (Optional):** To control multiple computers, pair each to a different channel (buttons 1, 2, or 3 on bottom of mouse). Press device button to switch between computers—takes about 1 second to reconnect.

4. **Install Logitech Options+ (Strongly Recommended):** Download from logitech.com/options. This software unlocks full mouse potential: customize all buttons, adjust scroll speed, create app-specific profiles, enable Logitech Flow, and check battery level. The mouse works without software, but Options+ dramatically improves productivity.

5. **Customize for Your Workflow:** In Options+, customize buttons for your most-used functions. The gesture button (thumb rest) can trigger Mission Control, Task View, or custom actions. Set DPI sensitivity for your preference. Try Logitech Flow if you work across multiple computers—it creates seamless cursor movement between devices.

## Common Questions

**Q: How does Logitech Flow work for controlling multiple computers?**

A: Logitech Flow is incredible for multi-computer setups. After pairing the mouse to multiple computers (all must have Options+ installed), enable Flow in the software. Now when you move the cursor to the edge of one screen, it seamlessly appears on the adjacent computer's screen—as if they're one continuous workspace. You can even copy text or files on one computer and paste on another. It works across Mac and Windows simultaneously. Many developers use this to work with a Mac laptop and Windows desktop simultaneously with a single mouse.

**Q: Will this work with my MacBook and iPad?**

A: Yes! Connect your MacBook via Bluetooth to device button 1. For iPad (iPadOS 13.4 or later), pair to button 2. Press the device button to switch between them. On MacBook, all features work including customizable buttons. On iPad, basic mouse functions work, but advanced features like button customization aren't available. The MX Master 3S works great for productivity on iPad when paired with a keyboard. Many users love this setup for mobile workstations.

**Q: What's the warranty?**

A: This Logitech mouse includes Logitech's 1-year limited hardware warranty covering defects and hardware failures. This includes battery issues, button malfunctions, and sensor problems. The silent switches are rated for 10 million clicks. For warranty service, contact Logitech Support at 1-877-775-6442 or visit support.logitech.com with your proof of purchase.

**Q: Can I return this if opened?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The mouse must be in good condition with all accessories (Bolt receiver, cable, documentation). Since this mouse is under $500 ($99), there is no restocking fee for returns. The MX Master 3S has a distinct ergonomic shape that most users love, but hand size and grip style vary, so we offer the return window to ensure it fits your needs.

**Q: Is this better than the Apple Magic Mouse for Mac users?**

A: They serve different purposes. The MX Master 3S is superior for productivity, multi-device workflows, ergonomics, and all-day comfort. It has more buttons, better ergonomics, longer battery life, and works while charging. It's objectively more functional. The Magic Mouse excels at macOS gesture integration with its Multi-Touch surface and matches Apple's aesthetic perfectly. For professionals who work long hours or use multiple devices, most prefer the MX Master 3S. For casual Mac users who prioritize aesthetics and native gestures, Magic Mouse works well.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Mouse not connecting or pairing fails**

Solution: Ensure the mouse is charged—connect the USB-C cable and charge for at least 30 minutes (works while charging). Check that the power switch on the bottom is "on." Press and hold the device selection button (1, 2, or 3) on the bottom for 3-5 seconds until the LED blinks rapidly. On your computer, ensure Bluetooth is enabled and scanning. Remove any previous "MX Master" entries from Bluetooth device list before re-pairing. If using Bolt receiver, try different USB ports—USB 3.0 ports can interfere with wireless signals, so try a USB 2.0 port. Restart your computer and try pairing again. If Bolt receiver doesn't work, pair via Bluetooth to test if receiver is faulty.

**Issue: Cursor movement is laggy, jumpy, or not smooth**

Solution: Check battery level in Logitech Options+ (or LED indicator on mouse when moving it). Low battery affects performance. Clean the sensor lens on the bottom with a soft cloth. If using Bolt receiver, move it closer to the mouse or use a USB extension cable to bring receiver closer to mouse position (USB 3.0 interference can affect range). Disable USB power management: on Windows, go to Device Manager > Universal Serial Bus controllers > right-click each USB Root Hub > Properties > Power Management > uncheck "Allow computer to turn off device." Adjust DPI/pointer speed in Options+—very high DPI can feel overly sensitive. Ensure latest firmware is installed via Options+ updates.

**Issue: Buttons not working or wrong functions assigned**

Solution: Install or reinstall Logitech Options+ to access button customization. Check button assignments in Options+ and reset to default if needed. Some buttons are app-specific—ensure you're configuring the right application profile. The gesture button (thumb rest) requires Options+ to function beyond basic button click. If physical buttons don't register clicks, clean around button edges with compressed air. For the scroll wheel, if free-spin mode is always active or never activates, there's a small button under the wheel—press it to toggle between precision (ratchet) and free-spin modes. If buttons still don't work, test on another computer to determine if it's a hardware or software issue. For hardware problems under warranty, contact Logitech support.
