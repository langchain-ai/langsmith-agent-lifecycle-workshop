## What's Included

Note: USB wall adapter not included (use any USB phone charger, 20W recommended for fastest charging).

## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Charge Before First Use:** Connect the USB-C cable to the port on the back of the speaker (behind rubber flap) and plug the USB-A end into a power adapter or computer USB port. The battery indicator lights show charging progress. Full charge takes about 2.5 hours. You can use the speaker while charging.

2. **Power On:** Press and hold the power button (marked with power icon) for 3 seconds. The speaker plays a startup sound and the Bluetooth button flashes blue, indicating it's in pairing mode on first use.

3. **Pair with Device:** On your phone/tablet/computer, enable Bluetooth and look for "JBL Flip 6" in the available devices list. Tap/click to connect. The speaker plays a confirmation sound and the Bluetooth LED stops flashing. On subsequent uses, the Flip 6 automatically connects to the last paired device when powered on.

4. **Adjust Volume:** Use the + and - buttons on top of the speaker to adjust volume. You can also control volume from your connected device. For best sound quality, keep source device volume at 80-100% and adjust speaker volume to your preference.

5. **Optional: Install JBL Portable App:** Download the JBL Portable app (iOS/Android) to customize EQ settings, check battery percentage, update firmware, and manage multiple paired devices. The app is optional—the speaker works perfectly without it.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this in the pool or shower?**

A: Yes! The Flip 6 is IP67 rated, meaning it's fully waterproof up to 1 meter depth for 30 minutes. You can use it by the pool, in the shower, or even drop it in water without damage. However, for best speaker longevity, avoid prolonged submersion. If used in chlorinated or salt water, rinse with fresh water afterward. The speaker floats partially but not fully upright, so watch it in deep water. Audio quality is slightly affected when the speaker is wet—let it dry for best sound. Make sure the USB-C port cover is closed when near water.

**Q: How does PartyBoost work with multiple speakers?**

A: PartyBoost lets you wirelessly connect multiple JBL speakers together. Press the PartyBoost button (infinity symbol) on all speakers you want to connect—they'll sync automatically and play the same music. You can connect two Flip 6 speakers in stereo mode (one plays left channel, one plays right) for true stereo separation, or connect many speakers to play in mono for louder, room-filling sound. All speakers must be PartyBoost-compatible (Flip 5/6, Charge 5, etc.). Note that PartyBoost replaced the older JBL Connect+ protocol, so Flip 6 can't connect to older models like Flip 4.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This JBL speaker includes JBL's 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects and hardware failures. This covers battery issues, Bluetooth connectivity problems, speaker driver failures, and button malfunctions. The warranty doesn't cover physical damage from drops, water damage beyond IP67 rating, or normal battery degradation over time. For warranty service, contact JBL customer service at 1-800-336-4525 or visit jbl.com/support with your proof of purchase.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The speaker must be in good condition with the USB-C cable and packaging. Since the JBL Flip 6 is under $500 ($129), there is no restocking fee for returns. Sound quality and loudness preferences are personal, so we provide the 14-day window to test it with your music in your actual usage environments (indoor, outdoor, etc.).

**Q: How loud does this get? Can it fill a room or backyard?**

A: The Flip 6 is surprisingly loud for its size—the 30W power output and dual passive radiators produce impressive volume and bass. It easily fills a medium-sized room (living room, bedroom) at moderate volumes. For outdoor use, it works great for backyard gatherings with 10-20 people if placed centrally. However, for very large spaces or loud outdoor parties, consider pairing two Flip 6 speakers with PartyBoost or upgrading to the larger JBL Charge 5 or Boombox series. Volume and bass are impressive given the compact size, but physics still applies—larger speakers move more air and produce deeper bass.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Won't connect to device or connection keeps dropping**

Solution: First, ensure the speaker is charged—low battery affects Bluetooth performance. Power off the speaker completely (hold power button), wait 10 seconds, then power back on. On your device, forget/remove "JBL Flip 6" from Bluetooth settings, then pair fresh. Move the speaker closer to your device—maximum range is about 100 feet in open space, but walls, WiFi routers, and other devices reduce range. Ensure no other devices are trying to connect simultaneously. If multiple devices are paired, the speaker may auto-connect to a different device—unpair unwanted devices. Update the speaker firmware via the JBL Portable app, as updates often improve connectivity. If audio cuts out during playback, interference from WiFi routers or other Bluetooth devices may be the cause—move the speaker or turn off other devices.

**Issue: Battery draining faster than expected**

Solution: Battery life is rated at 12 hours, but actual runtime varies significantly with volume. At maximum volume, expect 6-8 hours. At moderate volume (50-60%), you'll get closer to the rated 12 hours. Bass-heavy music consumes more power than podcasts or light music. Cold weather reduces battery performance—lithium-ion batteries deliver less capacity in cold temperatures. After 1-2 years of use, batteries naturally degrade and hold less charge. To maximize battery life, avoid storing the speaker at 0% charge for long periods—charge to 50% for storage. Disable PartyBoost if you're not using multiple speakers, as wireless transmission uses extra power. Check the JBL app for battery percentage—if it drains quickly to zero, the battery may need warranty service.

**Issue: Sound quality is poor, muffled, or lacking bass**

Solution: First, check that the speaker isn't wet or has water in the driver—if recently used near water, let it dry completely for several hours. Remove the fabric grille gently and check for debris or dust blocking the driver or passive radiators (the oval areas on the ends). Use compressed air to clean if needed. Ensure the speaker is placed on a hard surface rather than soft fabric—soft surfaces absorb bass and muffle sound. Try placing the speaker near a wall or in a corner, which reinforces bass frequencies. Check your music source—low-quality streaming (like low bitrate YouTube) sounds worse than high-quality sources (Spotify Premium, Apple Music, FLAC files). In the JBL Portable app, reset the EQ to default or adjust to your preference. Bluetooth audio is compressed—it won't sound as detailed as wired speakers, but should still be clear and punchy for casual listening.
