## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Charge the Keyboard:** Connect the USB-A to USB-C cable to charge the keyboard. A full charge takes about 3 hours. The status LED near the USB-C port indicates charging status. You can use the keyboard while charging.

2. **Choose Connection Method:** For wireless, turn on the keyboard using the power switch on the top edge. Press one of the three device buttons (1, 2, or 3) at the top. For first device, press and hold for 3 seconds to enter pairing mode (LED blinks). Alternatively, plug in the Bolt USB receiver to your computer for instant connection without pairing.

3. **Pair via Bluetooth:** On your computer, go to Bluetooth settings (System Settings > Bluetooth on Mac, Settings > Bluetooth on Windows). Look for "MX Keys" in available devices and click Connect/Pair. Once connected, the LED on the keyboard stops blinking.

4. **Add Additional Devices (Optional):** To add a second or third device, press device button 2 or 3, hold for 3 seconds to pair, then connect via Bluetooth on that device. Switch between devices by tapping the device buttons (no holding needed after initial pairing).

5. **Install Logitech Options+ (Recommended):** Download Logitech Options+ from logitech.com/options. This software lets you customize function keys, create app-specific shortcuts, update firmware, and check battery level. The keyboard works without it, but customization enhances productivity.

## Common Questions

**Q: How does multi-device switching work in practice?**

A: It's seamless! You pair each device once (Mac on button 1, Windows PC on button 2, iPad on button 3, for example). After that, just tap the device button to switch—takes about 1 second to reconnect. The keyboard remembers which OS each device uses and automatically adjusts key functions. So Command+C works on your Mac, but when you switch to Windows PC, Ctrl+C works correctly. It's perfect for people who work across multiple computers daily.

**Q: Can I use this keyboard with my MacBook and Dell laptop?**

A: Absolutely! This is one of the best keyboards for Mac/Windows users. Connect your MacBook via Bluetooth to device button 1, and your Dell to button 2. The keyboard automatically uses Mac key layout (Command, Option) when connected to the MacBook and Windows layout (Ctrl, Alt, Windows key) when connected to the Dell. All shortcuts work correctly on both systems. Many professionals use this exact setup.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This Logitech keyboard includes Logitech's 1-year limited hardware warranty covering defects and malfunctions. This covers battery issues, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and key failures under normal use. For warranty service, contact Logitech Support at 1-877-775-6442 or visit support.logitech.com. You'll need proof of purchase, which we can provide.

**Q: Can I return this if I've opened it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The keyboard should be in good condition with all included accessories (USB receiver, cable, documentation). Since this keyboard is under $500 ($119), there is no restocking fee for returns. This gives you time to test it with your devices and workflow.

**Q: How does the backlighting work?**

A: The MX Keys has smart backlighting that automatically turns on when your hands approach the keyboard (proximity sensor) and adjusts brightness based on ambient light. In bright rooms, backlighting may turn off to save battery. In dark rooms, it illuminates at appropriate brightness. You can customize brightness levels and timeout duration in Logitech Options+ software. Backlighting significantly impacts battery life—with it on constantly, expect 10 days; with auto-mode or off, expect 5 months.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Keyboard not connecting or pairing fails**

Solution: Ensure the keyboard is charged—connect the USB-C cable and charge for at least 30 minutes. Check that the power switch is in the "on" position. Press and hold a device button (1, 2, or 3) for 3-5 seconds until the LED blinks rapidly (pairing mode). On your computer, ensure Bluetooth is enabled and scanning for devices. Remove any previous "MX Keys" entries from your Bluetooth device list before pairing. If using the Bolt USB receiver, try a different USB port on your computer—USB 3.0 ports sometimes interfere with wireless signals; try a USB 2.0 port if available. Restart your computer and try pairing again.

**Issue: Keys typing wrong characters or shortcuts not working correctly**

Solution: This usually happens when the keyboard is set to the wrong OS mode. In Logitech Options+ software, check that each device is set to the correct operating system. On Mac, ensure System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard type is correctly identified (you may need to run the keyboard setup assistant). On Windows, check that the correct keyboard layout is selected in Settings > Time & Language > Keyboard. If certain shortcuts don't work, you can remap keys using Logitech Options+ to create custom shortcuts. For function keys (F1-F12), there's an Fn key that toggles between media keys and standard function keys—try pressing Fn + Esc to switch modes.

**Issue: Battery draining faster than expected or backlight issues**

Solution: Battery life varies dramatically with backlighting usage. If backlight stays on constantly, battery drains in 10 days. To improve battery life, use Logitech Options+ to set backlighting timeout to 5-30 seconds of inactivity. Reduce backlight brightness in the same software. If you don't need backlighting, turn it off completely to get 5 months of use. Check battery level in Logitech Options+ or press the battery indicator button on the top-left of the keyboard (LED shows charge level). If battery drains even with backlight off, ensure you're using the latest firmware (update via Options+ software). Bluetooth connectivity issues can cause battery drain—ensure stable connection to your devices.
