## Common Questions

**Q: Can I upgrade the RAM or storage?**

A: The RAM in this model is soldered and cannot be upgraded. The 8GB included is sufficient for everyday tasks like web browsing, office work, video streaming, and light multitasking. The 256GB SSD is replaceable by a technician, but doing so may void the warranty. For most users, 256GB is adequate for documents, photos, and applications. Consider using cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive) or an external hard drive for large media libraries.

**Q: Will this laptop work with my monitor or TV?**

A: Yes! The Pavilion 15 has an HDMI 2.1 port that connects directly to any modern monitor or TV—no adapter needed. Simply connect an HDMI cable (sold separately) from the laptop to your display. It supports up to 4K resolution. Note that the USB-C port on this model does NOT support video output, so you must use the HDMI port for external displays.

**Q: What's the warranty?**

A: This HP Pavilion includes HP's standard 1-year limited warranty covering hardware defects and malfunctions. You can extend coverage with HP Care Pack options at checkout or within 90 days of purchase. Extended warranties include options for accidental damage protection. For warranty service, contact HP at 1-800-474-6836 or visit hp.com/support.

**Q: Can I return this if I open it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The laptop should be in good condition with all accessories. Since the price is under $500, there is no restocking fee for returns (our 15% restocking fee only applies to items over $500). Defective items can be returned at any time during the return window with no fee.

**Q: Is this powerful enough for college/work from home?**

A: Yes! The Pavilion 15 is ideal for students and remote workers. It handles Google Docs, Microsoft Office, web browsing with many tabs, video calls, and streaming simultaneously. The 15.6-inch screen is large enough to work comfortably, and battery life gets you through most of a school or work day. It's perfect for online classes, assignments, presentations, and general productivity. However, if you're in engineering, architecture, or video editing programs requiring intensive software, consider our more powerful options.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Laptop running slow**

Solution: Check that Windows updates are complete (Settings > Windows Update). Updates installing in the background can slow performance. Close unnecessary browser tabs—Chrome and Edge can use significant memory with many tabs open. Check Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) to see which programs are using resources. OneDrive or other cloud services syncing large files can cause temporary slowdowns. Restart the laptop to clear memory. With 8GB RAM, avoid running too many applications simultaneously. Consider uninstalling programs you don't use via Settings > Apps. For long-term maintenance, run Disk Cleanup (search for it in Start menu) to free up storage space.

**Issue: Battery not lasting as long as expected**

Solution: Battery life varies significantly based on usage. Streaming video, video calls, and gaming drain battery faster than web browsing or document editing. Reduce screen brightness to 50-60% (brightness is a major power consumer). Go to Settings > System > Power > Power mode and select "Best power efficiency." Close unused applications and browser tabs. Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not needed. Check battery usage in Settings > System > Power & battery to see which apps use the most power. New laptops may have shorter battery life initially while Windows indexes files—this improves after a few days. After 1-2 years, batteries naturally degrade and hold less charge.

**Issue: Wi-Fi connection dropping or slow**

Solution: First, check if other devices have the same issue to determine if it's your network or the laptop. Move closer to your Wi-Fi router to test signal strength. Restart your router by unplugging it for 30 seconds. On the laptop, go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi and select "Forget" for your network, then reconnect and re-enter the password. Update the Wi-Fi driver: right-click Start > Device Manager > Network adapters > right-click your Wi-Fi adapter > Update driver. If on Windows 11, check that Wi-Fi isn't in power-saving mode: Device Manager > Network adapters > Wi-Fi adapter properties > Power Management tab > uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."
