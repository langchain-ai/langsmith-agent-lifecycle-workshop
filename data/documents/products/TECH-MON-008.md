## Compatibility

**Gaming Systems:**
- **PC Gaming:** Full 165Hz at 1440p via DisplayPort 1.4. HDMI 2.0 supports up to 144Hz at 1440p.
- **PlayStation 5:** Supports 1440p at 120Hz via HDMI 2.0 (check PS5 settings to enable 1440p output)

- **Older Consoles (PS4, Xbox One):** Work at 1080p/60Hz, upscaled to 1440p

**Computer Connectivity:**
- **Gaming PCs:** Use DisplayPort for full 165Hz. Most modern graphics cards (NVIDIA RTX, AMD RX series) support 1440p at high refresh rates.
- **MacBooks:** Requires USB-C to HDMI or DisplayPort adapter. Note: M1/M2/M3 MacBooks support up to 60Hz over HDMI, not the full 165Hz gaming refresh rate. Better suited for gaming PCs.
- **Windows Laptops:** Use HDMI or DisplayPort. Gaming laptops often support high refresh rates; check your laptop's specs.

**AMD FreeSync:**
- Compatible with AMD graphics cards (RX 400 series and newer)
- Also works with NVIDIA graphics cards (GTX 10-series and newer support "G-Sync Compatible" mode)
- Requires DisplayPort or HDMI connection

**Curved Display Considerations:**
- Curved monitors are best for single-user viewing (person sitting centered in front)
- Not ideal for multi-monitor setups due to curvature
- Excellent for gaming and movie watching due to immersive experience

## What's Included

- Samsung 32" Curved Gaming Monitor
- Height-adjustable stand
- Power cable
- DisplayPort cable (1.5m)
- Quick Setup Guide

Note: HDMI cable and USB-C adapters sold separately.

## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Assemble the Stand:** Attach the stand base to the stand neck using the included screw. Connect the assembled stand to the back of the monitor and secure with screws. Place monitor on desk and adjust height and tilt to your preference.

2. **Connect Power:** Plug the power cable into the monitor and a wall outlet. The monitor has an internal power supply.

3. **Connect to Gaming System:** For PC gaming, use the included DisplayPort cable for best performance (165Hz). For game consoles, use an HDMI cable (sold separately). Connect to one of the two HDMI ports on the monitor.

4. **Power On and Configure:** Press the power button (joystick on back-center of monitor). Navigate to Settings using the joystick and enable the highest refresh rate available. For PC: Settings > Picture > Refresh Rate > 165Hz (requires DisplayPort). Enable AMD FreeSync in Settings > System > FreeSync if you have a compatible graphics card.

5. **Optimize for Gaming:** Use the joystick to access Game Mode presets optimized for different game types (FPS, RTS, RPG). Adjust brightness and enable Eye Saver Mode for extended gaming sessions to reduce eye strain.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this monitor with my MacBook for work?**

A: Yes, but this monitor is really optimized for gaming. MacBooks can connect via USB-C to HDMI or DisplayPort adapter, but they won't take advantage of the high 165Hz refresh rate—MacBooks typically output at 60Hz. The curved screen and high refresh rate are designed for gaming, so for productivity work with a MacBook, you might prefer our flat professional monitors. That said, it will work fine for general use, and the large 32-inch screen is great for multitasking.

**Q: Do I need a special graphics card to use the high refresh rate?**

A: To display games at 165Hz, your graphics card needs to be capable of rendering games at high frame rates (165 FPS). Modern gaming GPUs (NVIDIA RTX 3060 and up, AMD RX 6600 and up) can achieve this in many games at 1440p with adjusted settings. You don't need a special card to use the monitor—any DisplayPort-capable GPU works—but you need a powerful GPU to maximize the refresh rate benefit in demanding games. For esports titles (Valorant, CS:GO, Overwatch), even mid-range GPUs can hit high frame rates.

**Q: What's the warranty?**

A: This Samsung monitor includes Samsung's 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects. Extended warranty and protection plans are available for purchase. For warranty service, contact Samsung at 1-800-726-7864 or visit samsung.com/us/support. We can provide proof of purchase for warranty claims.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The monitor must be in good condition with all original accessories. Since this monitor is under $500 (priced at $449), there is no restocking fee for returns. If you're unsure whether curved monitors are right for you, you have 14 days to try it and return if needed.

**Q: What's the difference between this and flat monitors?**

A: Curved monitors wrap around your peripheral vision, creating a more immersive experience for gaming and movies. The 1800R curvature means the monitor curves as much as a circle with an 1800mm radius. This reduces eye movement needed to see edges of the screen and creates depth perception. Curved is best for single-user gaming/entertainment. Flat monitors are better for professional work, multi-monitor setups, and viewing from multiple angles. It's a personal preference—some gamers love curves, others prefer flat.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Refresh rate stuck at 60Hz instead of 165Hz**

Solution: Ensure you're using the included DisplayPort cable, NOT HDMI—HDMI 2.0 maxes out at 144Hz on this monitor. On Windows, right-click desktop > Display settings > Advanced display > Choose a refresh rate > select 165Hz. On NVIDIA graphics cards, open NVIDIA Control Panel > Change resolution > select 165Hz. On AMD, open AMD Software > Display > select 165Hz. Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date. If refresh rate options don't show 165Hz, check that your GPU supports 1440p at 165Hz. In the monitor's OSD menu, go to Settings > Picture > Refresh Rate and ensure it's set to maximum.

**Issue: Screen tearing during gaming**

Solution: Enable AMD FreeSync in the monitor's OSD menu: press the joystick button > Settings > System > FreeSync > On. On NVIDIA GPUs, go to NVIDIA Control Panel > Set up G-SYNC > Enable G-SYNC for this display. On AMD GPUs, open AMD Software > Display > enable FreeSync. In-game, disable V-Sync as FreeSync handles synchronization. Ensure you're using DisplayPort cable—FreeSync works better over DisplayPort than HDMI. Check that your game is running at a frame rate within the monitor's range (typically 48-165 FPS). If tearing persists at very low frame rates (below 48 FPS), reduce graphics settings to maintain higher FPS.

**Issue: Image looks stretched or distorted on curved screen**

Solution: Ensure resolution is set to native 2560 x 1440 (QHD) in your system settings. Lower resolutions will look stretched on this large curved panel. In games, set resolution to 2560 x 1440 (or use "native resolution" option). Check the monitor's aspect ratio setting in OSD—it should be set to "Auto" or "16:9." The curved display will look unusual if you're coming from a flat monitor—give yourself a day or two to adjust; most users adapt quickly. Sit centered in front of the monitor at arm's length for optimal viewing. If specific applications look distorted, check if they have aspect ratio or display mode settings.
