## Common Questions

**Q: Can I upgrade the RAM or storage later?**

A: No, the memory and storage are integrated into the M3 chip and cannot be upgraded after purchase. If you work with large video files, 3D projects, or run virtual machines, consider upgrading to 16GB or 24GB of memory at the time of purchase. The 512GB storage is suitable for most users, but creative professionals may want 1TB or more.

**Q: Will this work with my existing monitors and professional equipment?**

A: Yes! The MacBook Pro has excellent connectivity. It includes an HDMI 2.1 port for direct monitor connection (no adapter needed), three Thunderbolt 4 ports for high-speed peripherals, and an SD card slot for camera cards. It supports multiple external displays and works with professional audio interfaces, video capture devices, and storage systems via Thunderbolt or USB-C.

**Q: What's covered under warranty?**

A: This MacBook Pro includes Apple's 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects and hardware failures, plus 90 days of complimentary technical support. AppleCare+ for Mac is available for purchase within 60 days, extending coverage to 3 years and adding accidental damage protection with a service fee. Many professionals opt for AppleCare+ given the value of the machine.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The MacBook Pro must be in good condition with all accessories. Due to the product value (over $500), there is a 15% restocking fee for non-defective returns. If there's a defect or we shipped the wrong item, there's no restocking fee.

**Q: Is this fast enough for 4K/8K video editing?**

A: Yes! The M3 chip has dedicated hardware for ProRes video encoding/decoding and can handle multiple streams of 4K ProRes video editing smoothly. For 8K editing, the base 8GB model works for basic editing, but we recommend upgrading to 16GB or more for complex timelines with effects. The dedicated media engines make this MacBook Pro significantly faster than Intel-based laptops for video work.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Mac running hot during intensive tasks**

Solution: This is normal behavior during heavy workloads like video rendering or compiling code—the MacBook Pro's thermal system is designed to handle sustained high performance. Ensure the MacBook is on a hard, flat surface (not on a blanket or soft surface that blocks vents). The bottom and rear vents need clear airflow. If fans are running loud, check Activity Monitor to see which apps are using high CPU—background processes like photo syncing or backups can cause temporary high usage. The MacBook will automatically manage thermal performance.

**Issue: App won't install or says "not optimized for this Mac"**

Solution: Some older apps may not be optimized for Apple Silicon. First, check for updates to the app—most developers have released Apple Silicon versions. If an update isn't available, macOS includes Rosetta 2 translation that allows Intel apps to run (though not at full speed). To install Rosetta 2, run the app and macOS will prompt you to install it automatically. If an app still won't work, contact the developer about Apple Silicon support. Most professional apps (Adobe, Microsoft, etc.) are now native for M3.

**Issue: Display looks fuzzy or wrong resolution on external monitor**

Solution: macOS may be using a scaled resolution. Go to System Settings > Displays and select "Default for display" to use the monitor's native resolution. If using HDMI, ensure you're using a high-quality HDMI 2.1 cable (included cables may be older standards). For best quality with 4K and higher resolution monitors, use a USB-C to DisplayPort cable or Thunderbolt connection instead of HDMI when possible. In Display settings, try toggling HDR on/off to see if it improves the image. Make sure your monitor's firmware is up to date.
