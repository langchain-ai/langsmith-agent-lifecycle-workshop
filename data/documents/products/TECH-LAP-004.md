## Common Questions

**Q: Can I upgrade the RAM or storage?**

A: No, the memory is soldered directly to the motherboard and cannot be upgraded after purchase. The 16GB included is suitable for most business tasks including running multiple applications, video conferencing, and virtual machines. The 1TB SSD provides ample storage for business documents, presentations, and local file storage. For users who work with very large datasets or run multiple VMs, consider our 32GB configuration at time of purchase.

**Q: Will this work with my company's docking station and monitors?**

A: Yes! The X1 Carbon works with Thunderbolt docks (both Lenovo and third-party brands), USB-C docks, and traditional USB docks. It also has HDMI and USB-A ports built-in, so you can connect monitors without adapters. For the best desk experience, we recommend a Thunderbolt 4 dock which provides single-cable connection for power, dual 4K displays, USB peripherals, and network—just plug in one cable when you return to your desk.

**Q: What's the warranty and support?**

A: This ThinkPad includes Lenovo's 1-year limited warranty with depot service. We strongly recommend Lenovo's Premier Support or Onsite Service options for business users, which can be purchased at checkout or within 90 days. These options provide on-site repair at your location (next business day), priority phone support, and accidental damage protection. Contact Lenovo at 1-855-253-6686 for warranty service or visit support.lenovo.com.

**Q: Can I return this if opened?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The laptop must be in good condition with all original accessories. Since this ThinkPad is priced over $500, there's a 15% restocking fee for non-defective returns. Business purchases should verify compatibility with your IT requirements before opening to avoid restocking fees. Defective items have no restocking fee.

**Q: What makes ThinkPad keyboards special?**

A: ThinkPad keyboards are legendary for their tactile feedback, key travel (1.5mm), and precision. They feature ergonomically sculpted keycaps, spill-resistant design (tested up to 60ml), and drainage channels to protect internal components. The keyboard includes a TrackPoint pointing stick in addition to the touchpad, allowing you to keep hands on the keyboard. Many professionals consider ThinkPad keyboards the best laptop keyboards available.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Laptop won't turn on or charge**

Solution: Disconnect the power adapter and hold the power button for 30 seconds to drain residual power. Reconnect the power adapter and try powering on. Check that the power adapter LED is lit when plugged in. Try a different power outlet. If using a USB-C charger or dock, ensure it provides at least 65W of power—lower-wattage chargers may not power on the laptop. Check if the battery needs servicing by running Lenovo Diagnostics (press Enter during startup, then F10). If problems persist, contact Lenovo support as the battery or power system may need service.

**Issue: Fingerprint reader not working**

Solution: Re-enroll your fingerprint in Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options > Fingerprint recognition. Make sure your finger is clean and dry—moisture affects the sensor. Swipe from the upper edge of the sensor to the center with firm, consistent pressure. Enroll the same finger 3-5 times for better recognition. If the sensor is unresponsive, check Windows Update for fingerprint driver updates. Restart the PC after driver updates. Some organizations disable fingerprint readers via policy—check with your IT department if the option is greyed out.

**Issue: Cannot connect to corporate VPN or network resources**

Solution: First, ensure you have stable internet connectivity by testing websites. Verify you're using the correct VPN credentials from your IT department—corporate passwords often expire and need resetting. Check that Windows firewall or security software isn't blocking VPN traffic. Try connecting via Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi to rule out wireless issues. Clear DNS cache by opening Command Prompt as administrator and running "ipconfig /flushdns". If using Intel vPro, ensure vPro firmware is up to date through Lenovo Commercial Vantage. Contact your IT help desk as they may need to provision certificates or adjust policies for your account.
