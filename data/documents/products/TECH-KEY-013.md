Note: USB-C power adapter not included (use Mac power adapter or any USB power source).

## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Charge Before First Use:** Connect the Lightning end of the cable to the port on the bottom edge of the mouse, and the USB-C end to your Mac or power adapter. Charge for 15-30 minutes before first use. Note: You cannot use the mouse while charging because the port is on the bottom.

2. **Turn On Mouse:** Slide the power switch on the bottom to the "on" position. A small green indicator shows when powered on.

3. **Automatic Pairing (Mac):** On macOS, the mouse should automatically appear in a pairing dialog when you turn it on for the first time. Click "Connect" or "Pair" when prompted. The mouse is now ready to use.

4. **Manual Pairing (if needed):** Go to System Settings > Bluetooth, ensure Bluetooth is on, and look for "Magic Mouse" in the devices list. Click "Connect" next to it.

5. **Customize Gestures:** Go to System Settings > Mouse to customize tracking speed, scrolling speed, and gesture behavior. Enable or disable specific gestures based on your preferences. Try the different gestures to get familiar with Multi-Touch control.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is the charging port on the bottom? Can I use the mouse while charging?**

A: The Lightning port is on the bottom of the mouse, so you cannot use it while charging—it must sit upside down during charging. Apple's design philosophy prioritizes aesthetics over charging convenience. However, the battery lasts about a month on a full charge, and just 2 minutes of charging provides several hours of use. Many users charge it during lunch breaks or overnight. If this is a dealbreaker, consider the Logitech MX Master 3S which can be used while charging.

**Q: Can I use this mouse with my Windows PC?**

A: It technically works via Bluetooth on Windows, but the experience is poor. Basic clicking works, but the touch scrolling surface feels unnatural on Windows, gestures don't work, and right-clicking can be problematic. The Magic Mouse is designed exclusively for macOS and doesn't translate well to Windows. For Windows or multi-platform use, we strongly recommend the Logitech MX Master 3S or Logitech MX Anywhere which are designed for cross-platform compatibility.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This Apple Magic Mouse includes Apple's standard 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects, battery issues, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and Multi-Touch surface failures. For warranty service, contact Apple Support at 1-800-MY-APPLE or visit apple.com/support. You can purchase AppleCare+ to extend coverage if desired.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The mouse must be in good condition with the Lightning cable and all original packaging. Since this mouse is under $500 ($79), there is no restocking fee for returns. The Magic Mouse has a unique design that some users love and others find uncomfortable, so we understand if you need to try it before committing.

**Q: Is this mouse comfortable for extended use?**

A: Comfort is subjective and depends on your hand size and grip style. The Magic Mouse has a low-profile design that works well for palm grip and smaller hands. Some users with larger hands or who prefer ergonomic mice find it uncomfortable for all-day use due to its flat, minimalist design. The smooth top surface feels premium but can be slippery. If ergonomics and comfort are priorities for extended work sessions, consider the Logitech MX Master 3S which has a sculpted ergonomic shape designed for all-day use.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Mouse not connecting or pairing with Mac**

Solution: Ensure the mouse is charged—connect it via Lightning cable for 15-30 minutes. Check that the power switch on the bottom is in the "on" position (green visible). On your Mac, go to System Settings > Bluetooth and ensure Bluetooth is enabled. If the mouse appears as "Not Connected," click "Connect." If it doesn't appear, turn the mouse off and back on, then look for it in the Bluetooth device list. Remove other Bluetooth mice from your Mac's Bluetooth settings to avoid conflicts. If problems persist, reset the Bluetooth module: hold Shift+Option and click the Bluetooth menu bar icon, then select "Reset the Bluetooth module" and restart your Mac.

**Issue: Tracking is erratic, jumpy, or cursor not moving smoothly**

Solution: Clean the bottom of the mouse gently with a soft, lint-free cloth—dirt on the sensor or aluminum base causes tracking issues. Ensure you're using the mouse on an appropriate surface—avoid glass, mirrors, or highly reflective surfaces. Mouse pads with consistent texture work best. Check battery level (System Settings > Bluetooth, hover over Magic Mouse) and charge if low. Adjust tracking speed in System Settings > Mouse—slower tracking may feel more controlled. If the mouse stutters or lags, move closer to your Mac or remove obstacles between the mouse and computer. Interference from other Bluetooth devices or Wi-Fi routers can affect performance—try disconnecting other Bluetooth devices temporarily.

**Issue: Right-click not working or gestures not functioning**

Solution: For right-clicking, ensure "Secondary click" is enabled in System Settings > Mouse. You can set it to click on the right side or left side of the mouse surface. The Magic Mouse detects which side you press based on pressure and position—try clicking more firmly and clearly on the right edge. For gesture issues, go to System Settings > Mouse and check that gestures are enabled. Try turning gestures off and back on. Clean the top Multi-Touch surface gently with a slightly damp cloth—dirt or skin oils can interfere with gesture detection. If gestures work inconsistently, restart your Mac. Ensure macOS is up to date (System Settings > General > Software Update) as updates often include input device improvements.
