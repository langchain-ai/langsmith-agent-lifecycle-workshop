## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Attach Stand (Pre-attached):** The Yeti comes with the desktop stand already attached. Simply unfold the legs and place the microphone on your desk with the Blue logo facing you. The controls are on the back.

2. **Connect to Computer:** Plug the USB cable into the Yeti's Mini-USB port (bottom/back of mic) and the USB-A end into your computer. The microphone powers on automatically when connected—no batteries or external power needed.

3. **Select Input Device:** On Mac, go to System Settings > Sound > Input and select "Yeti Stereo Microphone." On Windows, right-click the speaker icon in taskbar > Sound settings > Input > select "Yeti Stereo Microphone." The computer now uses the Yeti as the default microphone.

4. **Choose Polar Pattern:** Turn the dial on the back of the Yeti to select your polar pattern. For most users (podcasting, streaming, vocals), start with Cardioid mode (icon pointing forward). This focuses on sound directly in front of the mic while rejecting sound from the sides and back.

5. **Adjust Gain and Test:** Speak into the front of the microphone at your normal volume from about 6-12 inches away. Turn the gain knob (back of mic) clockwise to increase sensitivity. Watch your recording software's input meter—aim for levels around -12 to -6 dB, peaking occasionally into yellow but never red (distortion). Press the mute button on front to silence the mic (LED glows red when muted).

## Common Questions

**Q: Which polar pattern should I use for my situation?**

A: **Cardioid (most common):** Use for solo podcasting, streaming, singing, voiceovers, or anytime you're the only person speaking. It focuses on your voice in front of the mic while rejecting background noise from sides/back. **Stereo:** Use for recording instruments, ASMR, nature sounds, or when you want left-right spatial information in your recording. **Omnidirectional:** Use for conference calls with multiple people around the mic, or recording a group discussion. **Bidirectional:** Use for two-person interviews or conversations where people sit on opposite sides of the mic. For beginners unsure, start with Cardioid—it works for 90% of use cases.

**Q: Can I use this with my iPhone or iPad?**

A: Not directly—the Yeti requires a USB connection to a computer and draws power from USB. iPhones and iPads don't provide sufficient power through their Lightning/USB-C ports for the Yeti, even with adapters. For mobile recording, consider a dedicated mobile microphone like the Shure MV88+ or Rode VideoMic. The Yeti is designed for desktop recording and streaming with computers.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This Blue Yeti includes Blue Microphones' (Logitech) 2-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty covers capsule failures, USB connectivity issues, and control malfunctions. Physical damage from drops or liquid damage is not covered. For warranty service, contact Logitech/Blue support at 1-877-578-4804 or visit support.logi.com. Register your product for easier warranty claims.

**Q: Can I return this if I've opened it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The microphone must be in good condition with the stand and USB cable. Since the Blue Yeti is under $500 ($129), there is no restocking fee for returns. Microphone choice is personal and depends on your voice, room acoustics, and use case, so we provide the 14-day window to test it in your actual recording environment.

**Q: My audio has background noise or doesn't sound professional. What should I do?**

A: First, check your polar pattern—use Cardioid to reject background noise. Lower the gain knob on the Yeti—high gain amplifies background noise. Position the mic 6-8 inches from your mouth and speak at a consistent distance. Record in a quiet room away from computers, fans, or AC vents. Soft furnishings (curtains, carpets, furniture) absorb echo and improve sound quality. Consider a pop filter to reduce plosives (p's and b's). In your recording software, check that input levels aren't too high (should peak around -12 to -6 dB). Room acoustics have huge impact—even professional mics sound poor in echoey, untreated rooms. Basic acoustic treatment (foam panels, bass traps) dramatically improves results.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Computer not recognizing the Yeti or no sound**

Solution: First, try a different USB port—preferably one directly on your computer rather than a USB hub. USB hubs sometimes don't provide enough power. On Mac, check System Settings > Sound > Input and ensure "Yeti Stereo Microphone" is selected. On Windows, right-click speaker icon > Sound settings > Input device and select the Yeti. Verify the Yeti isn't muted (press mute button on front—LED should not be red). Check that the USB cable is fully inserted at both ends. Try the cable on another device to ensure it's not faulty. Restart your computer with the Yeti connected. If it still doesn't appear, try a different USB cable (standard USB-A to Mini-USB). Check for USB driver issues in Device Manager (Windows) or Audio MIDI Setup (Mac).

**Issue: Audio sounds distorted, clipping, or too quiet**

Solution: For distortion/clipping: Lower the gain knob on the back of the Yeti—high gain causes distortion. Move farther from the mic (8-12 inches instead of 2-3 inches). Speak at normal volume rather than yelling. In your recording software, ensure input levels peak around -12 to -6 dB on the meters. For audio too quiet: Increase the gain knob gradually until you see good levels in your software. Move closer to the microphone (6-8 inches). Ensure you're speaking into the front of the mic (Blue logo side) not the top or sides. Check that your software's input level/slider is set adequately (usually 100%). In post-processing, you can apply compression and normalization to increase perceived loudness without distortion.

**Issue: Hearing echo, feedback, or strange sounds through headphones**

Solution: Echo/feedback usually occurs when your headphones are too loud and sound leaks back into the microphone. Lower the headphone volume using the knob on the front of the Yeti. Use closed-back headphones instead of open-back to prevent sound leakage. Ensure headphones are plugged into the Yeti's headphone jack (front), not your computer's jack, for zero-latency monitoring. If you hear buzzing or humming, try a different USB port or USB hub—ground loop issues cause electrical noise. Turn off "Listen to this device" in Windows sound settings if enabled (causes echo). In recording software, disable "software monitoring" or "input monitoring"—the Yeti's hardware monitoring is superior and has zero latency.
