## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Plan Your Cable Routes:** Before sticking anything down, lay out your cables and plan where they should route. Identify problem areas: cables falling behind the desk, tangled groups, excess cable length. Decide where clips should go (desk edges, monitor back, under desk) to route cables neatly. Take photos of your current setup to appreciate the improvement later!

2. **Clean Surfaces:** Use the included alcohol prep pads to clean areas where you'll mount adhesive cable clips. Wait 2-3 minutes for alcohol to evaporate completely. Clean, dry surfaces are critical for strong adhesive bonding. Don't skip this step—dirty or oily surfaces cause clips to fall off.

3. **Mount Cable Clips Strategically:** Peel backing from adhesive clips and firmly press onto planned locations for 30 seconds. Let adhesive cure for 1 hour before routing cables (24 hours for maximum strength). Common positions: desk edge for routing cables down to power strips, back of monitor for video cables, under desk along edge for power cables. Each clip holds up to 3 cables in its slots.

4. **Bundle and Tie Cables:** For multiple cables running the same path (like power cables to a power strip), use cable sleeves to bundle them into one neat tube. Thread cables through the sleeve's zippered opening. For securing excess cable length, wrap Velcro ties around coiled cables—adjustable and reusable for when you need to add/remove cables later.

5. **Hide Power Strips and Adapters:** Place the cable management box on or under your desk and put your power strip, excess cable coils, and bulky power adapters inside. Route cables in through the side holes. The box hides the ugly tangle while ventilation slots prevent heat buildup. Your desk now looks clean and professional!

## Common Questions

**Q: Will the adhesive damage my desk when removed?**

A: The 3M adhesive is designed to bond strongly but remove cleanly from most smooth, non-porous surfaces like wood desks with finish, laminate, metal, glass, and plastic. To remove, gently peel away slowly at a shallow angle—don't yank straight up. If any residue remains, use rubbing alcohol or adhesive remover to clean. However, on delicate surfaces (unfinished wood, painted surfaces with weak paint, wallpaper), there's a small risk of finish removal. Test on an inconspicuous area first if you're concerned, or use removable command strips instead of the included adhesive clips.

**Q: How many cables can this kit organize?**

A: The kit handles 10-15+ cables depending on your setup. The 4 adhesive clips provide 12 cable routing positions (3 slots per clip). The 2 cable sleeves each bundle 5-8 cables depending on thickness. The cable box holds a 6-outlet power strip plus adapters and excess cable coils. For a typical desk setup (laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, phone charger, lamp), this kit is more than sufficient. For elaborate gaming setups with multiple monitors and many peripherals, you might need a second kit or additional cable ties.

**Q: Can I reuse the adhesive clips if I move my desk?**

A: No, the adhesive cable clips are single-use. Once removed, the adhesive loses its bonding strength and won't restick reliably. This is a tradeoff for the strong hold needed to support cables long-term. However, the Velcro ties are infinitely reusable—you can unwrap, move, and rewrap them hundreds of times. The cable sleeves are also reusable (just unzip, add/remove cables, rezip). If you move frequently, use the clips only for permanent cable routing and rely more on Velcro ties for flexibility.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This cable management kit includes a 1-year limited manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This covers adhesive failure shortly after installation (indicating bad adhesive batch), zipper failures on cable sleeves, and Velcro tie manufacturing defects. The warranty doesn't cover normal adhesive weakening after removal/reinstallation, damage from improper surface preparation, or wear from repeated use. For warranty claims, contact us with your proof of purchase and description of the defect.

**Q: Can I return this after opening and using some pieces?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened accessories within 14 days of delivery. However, if you've used the adhesive clips (removed backing and stuck them to surfaces), those specific pieces can't be reused and lose their value. You can still return the kit within 14 days even if clips are used. Since this kit is under $500 ($19), there is no restocking fee. We understand that cable management requires trial and error, so the 14-day window gives you time to test the solution for your specific desk setup.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Adhesive clips falling off or not sticking well**

Solution: The most common cause is improper surface preparation. Remove the clip, clean both the surface and the adhesive side of the clip with rubbing alcohol, and let dry completely. Ensure the surface is smooth—adhesive doesn't work well on textured, rough, or porous surfaces like bare wood, textured paint, or fabric. Apply the clip and press firmly for 60 seconds to activate the adhesive, then don't put cables in it for 24 hours while the adhesive fully cures. Temperature matters—adhesive bonds poorly in very cold conditions (below 50°F); warm the surface with a hair dryer if installing in a cold room. If clips still fall off on a smooth, clean surface, you may have a defective batch—contact warranty support for replacement clips.

**Issue: Cables slipping out of clip slots**

Solution: Cable clips work best with cables 0.15" to 0.3" in diameter (typical USB, HDMI, power cables). Very thin cables (like phone charging cables) can slip out—try routing them through the middle slot where the clip is tighter, or use a Velcro tie instead. Thick cables (like some braided power cables) may not fit the slots—use cable sleeves or larger clips. Ensure cables are pressed fully into the slot with a clicking sensation. If cables have connectors near the clip, the connector's bulk may pull the cable out—position clips away from connectors. For cables that slip frequently, supplement with a small zip tie or wrap a piece of electrical tape around the cable just before the clip to create a stopper.

**Issue: Cable sleeve won't close or zipper stuck**

Solution: Cable sleeves accommodate 5-8 standard cables (varies by cable thickness). If the sleeve is overstuffed with too many or too thick cables, it won't close properly—remove some cables or distribute them across both sleeves. Arrange cables inside so they're not bunched up at the zipper teeth. For a stuck zipper, check if a cable is caught in the zipper teeth—carefully pull it out while slightly opening the zipper. Don't force the zipper as it can break the teeth. If cables are too bulky, consider running fewer cables through the sleeve or letting some run separately. The sleeves work best for organizing 4-6 medium-thickness cables (power cables, HDMI, USB) into one neat bundle for routing behind desks or along walls.
