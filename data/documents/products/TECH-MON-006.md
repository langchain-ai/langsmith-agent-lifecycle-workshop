## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Assemble the Stand:** The stand comes pre-attached. Place the monitor on your desk and adjust the height, tilt, and swivel to your preferred viewing position.

2. **Connect Power:** Plug the power cable into the monitor and a wall outlet. The monitor has an internal power supply (no bulky brick).

3. **Connect to Computer:** Choose your connection method based on your laptop/desktop. For MacBooks, use the included USB-C cable for single-cable connection (video + charging). For computers with HDMI, use the included HDMI cable. For best quality, use DisplayPort if available.

4. **Power On:** Press the power button on the bottom-right of the monitor. It should automatically detect the video signal. If not, press the input button to manually select the correct source (HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C).

5. **Adjust Display Settings:** On macOS, go to System Settings > Displays to adjust resolution and scaling. On Windows, go to Settings > Display to adjust resolution and text size. We recommend using 150-200% scaling for comfortable text readability at 4K resolution on a 27" display.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this monitor work with my MacBook Air/Pro?**

A: Yes! All modern MacBooks work perfectly with this monitor. For the best experience, use the included USB-C cable which carries video signal AND charges your MacBook at 65W simultaneously. If your MacBook only has Thunderbolt ports, the USB-C connection still works (Thunderbolt is backward compatible with USB-C). Alternatively, you can use a USB-C to HDMI adapter if you prefer HDMI connection.

**Q: Do I need to buy any cables or adapters?**

A: Most users won't need additional cables—this monitor includes HDMI, USB-C, and DisplayPort cables. However, if your laptop only has HDMI output and you want the best quality, consider a DisplayPort to HDMI cable (HDMI works fine for most users). For older MacBooks with Mini DisplayPort, use the included DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This Dell monitor includes Dell's standard 3-year Advanced Exchange warranty. If there's a hardware issue, Dell ships a replacement monitor before you return the defective one (minimal downtime). The warranty covers dead pixels, backlight issues, and hardware failures. Contact Dell at 1-800-624-9896 or visit dell.com/support for warranty service.

**Q: Can I return this if opened?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The monitor should be in good condition with all accessories and cables. Since this monitor is priced over $500, there's a 15% restocking fee for non-defective returns. If the monitor arrives damaged or defective, there's no restocking fee and we'll cover return shipping.

**Q: Can I use this in portrait (vertical) mode?**

A: Yes! The included stand has a pivot feature that rotates the monitor 90° for portrait orientation. This is excellent for reading documents, coding, or web browsing. You'll need to adjust the display rotation in your computer's display settings after pivoting. Portrait mode works on both Mac and Windows.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: No signal or display not detected**

Solution: First, ensure the monitor is powered on (LED should be lit). Press the input button on the monitor to cycle through sources (HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C) and make sure the correct input is selected. Check that cables are firmly connected at both ends. Try a different cable if available. On laptops, you may need to wake the screen or press a function key (often Fn + F4 or F8) to enable external display output. On Mac, go to System Settings > Displays and click "Detect Displays." On Windows, press Windows + P to select display mode (Duplicate or Extend).

**Issue: Display looks blurry or text is too small**

Solution: Ensure the monitor is set to its native 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) in your computer's display settings. On Windows, right-click desktop > Display settings > check resolution is set to 3840 x 2160. If text looks too small, increase display scaling to 150-200% instead of lowering resolution. On macOS, go to System Settings > Displays and select "Scaled" to choose a comfortable scaling option—"More Space" or "Default" usually works well. Using a non-native resolution will cause blurriness.

**Issue: USB hub ports not working**

Solution: The monitor's USB ports require a USB connection to your computer in addition to the video cable. Connect the included USB Type-B to Type-A cable from the monitor's upstream USB port (marked with a computer icon) to a USB port on your computer. This enables the four USB-A ports on the monitor. If using USB-C for video, the USB hub should work automatically without a separate cable. In Windows, you may need to install Dell Display Manager software for full USB functionality. Check that the USB devices you're connecting are working by testing them directly on your computer first.
