## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Unbox and Attach Wrist Rest (Optional):** Remove keyboard from packaging. If you want the wrist rest for ergonomic support, align it with the bottom edge of the keyboard—it attaches magnetically. You can use the keyboard without it.

2. **Connect to Computer:** Plug the USB connector into an available USB port on your computer. The keyboard is fully plug-and-play and will work immediately. The RGB lighting turns on automatically with a default rainbow wave effect.

3. **Test Basic Functionality:** Open a text document and test typing. All keys should work without any driver installation. Press the lighting button (top right area, usually marked with LED icon) to cycle through preset RGB effects.

4. **Install Software (Windows Only, Optional):** Download the keyboard software from the manufacturer's website (link in manual). This software unlocks full RGB customization, macro programming, and profile management. Installation takes 2-3 minutes.

5. **Customize for Gaming:** Use the software to create lighting profiles and program macros for your favorite games. Enable gaming mode by pressing Fn + F9 (or designated combination) to disable the Windows key during gameplay. Set up WASD highlighting or game-specific lighting zones to enhance visibility.

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between Cherry MX Red, Blue, and Brown switches?**

A: This keyboard uses Cherry MX Red switches, which are linear (smooth from top to bottom) with no tactile bump or click sound. They're quiet and popular for gaming because of fast actuation. Cherry MX Blue switches are clicky and tactile (you hear and feel each keypress)—great for typing but noisy. Cherry MX Brown switches are tactile but quiet (you feel a bump but no click)—a middle ground for gaming and typing. Reds are the most popular for gaming. We also carry keyboards with Blue and Brown switches if you prefer different feedback.

**Q: Will this work with my MacBook for coding?**

A: Yes, it works as a standard keyboard via USB—just plug it in and type. However, macOS doesn't support the companion software, so you can't customize RGB lighting or program macros on a Mac. The RGB will stay on the last Windows-programmed setting or a default pattern. For basic typing and coding, it works perfectly fine. The mechanical switches provide excellent tactile feedback for long coding sessions. If you need Mac-specific function keys and full macOS integration, consider the Logitech MX Keys instead.

**Q: What's the warranty?**

A: This keyboard includes a 1-year limited manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. Cherry MX switches themselves are rated for 50 million keystrokes per key, which should last many years even with heavy use. The warranty covers switch failures, LED issues, and USB connection problems. For warranty claims, contact us with your proof of purchase and we'll coordinate with the manufacturer.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The keyboard must be in good condition with all accessories (wrist rest, keycaps, keycap puller). Since the price is under $500 ($149), there's no restocking fee for returns. Mechanical keyboards have a different feel than membrane keyboards, so we understand if you need to try it out to see if the Cherry MX Red switches are right for you.

**Q: Is this keyboard too loud for office use?**

A: Cherry MX Red switches are actually one of the quieter mechanical switch types since they're linear with no click mechanism. They're quieter than Cherry MX Blue or clicky switches. That said, mechanical keyboards are generally louder than membrane keyboards due to the key bottoming out on the plate. If noise is a concern, you can install rubber O-rings under the keycaps to dampen the sound (sold separately), or consider the Logitech MX Keys which is much quieter and better suited for office environments.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Some keys not working or not registering**

Solution: First, test the keyboard on a different computer to determine if it's a hardware or software issue. If keys work on another PC, the problem is with your computer's USB drivers. Try a different USB port—use a USB 2.0 port if you were using USB 3.0 (sometimes there are compatibility issues). On Windows, uninstall keyboard drivers in Device Manager, then disconnect and reconnect the keyboard to reinstall drivers. If specific keys don't work on any computer, debris or liquid may be the cause. Unplug the keyboard, remove the affected keycap using the included keycap puller, and clean underneath with compressed air. If a switch is defective and under warranty, contact support for replacement.

**Issue: RGB lighting not working or stuck on one color**

Solution: Press the lighting button (usually top-right of keyboard, marked with LED icon) to cycle through different RGB effects. If all LEDs are off, you may have accidentally turned them off—press the lighting button multiple times. To adjust brightness, hold Fn and press the brightness keys (often up/down arrows or +/-). If RGB is stuck on one effect, install or reinstall the software to access full lighting customization. Check that the USB port provides adequate power—try a port directly on your computer rather than a USB hub. Some USB ports, especially on laptops, may provide insufficient power for full RGB brightness. If certain keys' LEDs don't light up, the LED may be defective—contact warranty support.

**Issue: Keys typing multiple characters or registering when not pressed**

Solution: This is called "key chatter" and can occur with mechanical switches. First, clean the affected switch—remove the keycap with the keycap puller and use compressed air to blow out debris. If the issue persists, it may be a defective switch. Download the latest software and firmware update, as firmware updates often include debounce algorithm improvements. You can also increase the debounce time in the software settings if available. If a specific switch chatters consistently and cleaning doesn't help, the switch may need replacement. Contact warranty support—with Cherry MX switches, individual switches can often be replaced without replacing the entire keyboard. As a temporary workaround, you can remap the problematic key to a different key in the software.
