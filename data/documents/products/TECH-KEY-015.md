## What's Included

- Wireless Keyboard (full-size)
- Wireless Mouse (3-button, ambidextrous)
- Single USB wireless receiver (pre-paired with both devices)
- 2x AAA batteries for keyboard
- 1x AA battery for mouse
- User manual

Note: Batteries are standard consumer batteries; replacements available at any store.

## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Insert Batteries:** For the keyboard, open the battery compartment on the back and insert 2 AAA batteries (included) matching the +/- polarity indicators. For the mouse, open the battery compartment (usually bottom or top) and insert 1 AA battery.

2. **Plug in USB Receiver:** Find the USB wireless receiver (small USB dongle, often stored inside mouse battery compartment). Plug it into an available USB port on your computer. The receiver is pre-paired with both keyboard and mouse—no pairing process needed.

3. **Turn On Devices:** Slide the power switch on the keyboard and mouse to "on" position. The switches are typically on the bottom or side of each device. Wait 5-10 seconds for the devices to connect to the receiver.

4. **Test Functionality:** Type on the keyboard and move the mouse to verify both are working. If either doesn't work immediately, try turning it off and back on. The connection should be automatic.

5. **Adjust Settings (Optional):** On Windows, adjust keyboard repeat rate and mouse pointer speed in Settings > Devices. On Mac, go to System Settings > Keyboard and Mouse to adjust preferences. The devices work out of the box without any driver installation.

## Common Questions

**Q: How long do the batteries last?**

A: The keyboard batteries (2x AAA) typically last 18-24 months with normal use (few hours daily). The mouse battery (1x AA) lasts 10-12 months. Battery life varies based on usage—heavy users will need replacements sooner. When batteries run low, the keyboard and mouse may become less responsive or have intermittent connectivity. We recommend using quality alkaline batteries or rechargeable NiMH batteries for best performance.

**Q: Can I use this combo with my MacBook?**

A: Yes, it works on MacBooks via the USB receiver (you may need a USB-C to USB-A adapter for newer MacBooks). Basic typing and mouse functions work perfectly. However, some Windows-specific keys won't function on macOS, and multimedia keys may not work. The keyboard layout shows Windows keys (Windows key, Alt) instead of Mac keys (Command, Option), but they functionally map correctly. For better Mac integration, consider the Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse or Logitech MX products with native Mac support.

**Q: What's the warranty?**

A: This keyboard and mouse combo includes a 1-year limited manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This covers device failures, connectivity issues, and button/key malfunctions under normal use (does not cover battery replacement, which is user-maintained). For warranty claims, contact us with your proof of purchase and we'll coordinate with the manufacturer.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. Both devices should be in good condition with all original accessories (receiver, batteries, manual). Since this combo is under $500 ($39), there is no restocking fee for returns. The 14-day window gives you time to test compatibility with your computer and ensure the devices meet your needs.

**Q: What happens if I lose the USB receiver?**

A: Unfortunately, the keyboard and mouse are permanently paired to the specific USB receiver that comes in the package. If you lose the receiver, the devices cannot be re-paired to a different receiver or used via Bluetooth (they don't have Bluetooth). You would need to purchase a new combo. We recommend keeping the receiver plugged into your computer at all times, or if you must remove it, store it in a safe, memorable location. Some users attach the receiver to their keychain or keep it in a specific drawer.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Keyboard or mouse not working or intermittent connectivity**

Solution: First, check batteries—low batteries cause most connectivity issues. Replace with fresh batteries and ensure correct +/- polarity. Ensure both devices are powered on (check power switches). Try moving the USB receiver to a different USB port, preferably one directly on your computer rather than a USB hub. USB 3.0 ports can sometimes interfere with 2.4GHz wireless—if receiver is in a USB 3.0 port near other USB 3.0 devices, try a USB 2.0 port or move the receiver farther from USB 3.0 devices using a USB extension cable. Reduce distance between devices and receiver—maximum range is about 30 feet but obstacles like metal objects can reduce range. Remove other wireless devices (like other wireless keyboards/mice) that might cause interference.

**Issue: Certain keys not working on keyboard**

Solution: Check that batteries have sufficient charge and are properly installed. Test if it's specific keys or random keys—specific keys not working might indicate debris or damage. For stuck or unresponsive keys, turn off the keyboard, turn it upside down, and gently shake to dislodge debris. Use compressed air to blow out any particles under the keys. If multimedia keys (volume, play/pause) don't work, they may not be supported on your operating system—this is common on macOS and Linux. If letter/number keys don't work, try the keyboard on another computer to determine if it's a hardware issue. For persistent problems, the keyboard may have failed and requires warranty replacement.

**Issue: Mouse cursor jumping or moving erratically**

Solution: Clean the optical sensor on the bottom of the mouse with a soft, dry cloth—dirt on the sensor causes tracking issues. Ensure you're using the mouse on an appropriate surface—avoid glass, mirrors, or highly reflective surfaces. Use a mouse pad for best tracking. Check battery level and replace with fresh batteries. If the cursor jumps when moving to certain areas, interference may be the issue—move the USB receiver to a different port or use a USB extension cable to position it closer to the mouse. Wireless interference from routers, phones, or other wireless devices can affect performance—try turning off other devices to test. If the mouse still tracks poorly on a good surface with new batteries, the optical sensor may be failing—contact warranty support.
