## Setup & Getting Started

2. **Turn On Keyboard:** Slide the power switch on the back edge to the "on" position. A green indicator shows when powered on.

3. **Automatic Pairing (Mac):** On macOS, the keyboard should automatically appear in a pairing dialog. Click "Connect" or "Pair" when prompted. The keyboard is now ready to use.

4. **Manual Pairing (if needed):** Go to System Settings > Bluetooth, ensure Bluetooth is on, and look for "Magic Keyboard" in the devices list. Click "Connect" next to it.

5. **Check Battery Level:** Click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar and hover over "Magic Keyboard" to see the current battery level. You can also check in System Settings > Bluetooth.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this keyboard with my Windows PC?**

A: Technically yes—it will connect via Bluetooth and basic typing works. However, this keyboard is really designed for Mac, and on Windows you'll lose most function key functionality, media controls won't work properly, and the key labels (Command, Option) don't match Windows conventions. If you need a keyboard for both Mac and Windows, we recommend the Logitech MX Keys which is designed for multi-platform use with dedicated Mac and Windows modes.

**Q: Can I connect this to multiple devices and switch between them?**

A: No, the Magic Keyboard can only be paired to one device at a time. To use it with a different device, you need to disconnect from the current device and repair with the new one. This makes it less convenient for multi-device setups. If you need to switch between multiple devices frequently (like Mac and iPad), consider the Logitech MX Keys which supports 3-device switching.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This Apple Magic Keyboard includes Apple's standard 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects and hardware failures. The warranty covers battery issues, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and key failures. For warranty service, contact Apple Support at 1-800-MY-APPLE or visit apple.com/support. You can also purchase AppleCare+ to extend coverage.

**Q: Can I return this if I've opened it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The keyboard must be in good condition with the cable and all original packaging. Since this keyboard is under $500 (priced at $99), there is no restocking fee for returns. This gives you two weeks to try it and ensure it fits your workflow.

**Q: How do I know when to charge the battery?**

A: macOS displays low battery warnings when the keyboard drops below 10-15%. You can check battery level anytime by clicking the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. The keyboard continues working while charging, so you can plug it in and keep typing. A full charge takes about 2 hours and provides approximately 1 month of use. Many users charge it monthly as part of their routine.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Keyboard not connecting or pairing with Mac**

Solution: First, ensure the keyboard is charged—connect it via USB-C to Lightning cable for 15 minutes. Check that the power switch on the back is in the "on" position (green visible). On your Mac, go to System Settings > Bluetooth and ensure Bluetooth is enabled. If the keyboard appears as "Not Connected," click "Connect." If it doesn't appear at all, turn the keyboard off and back on, then look for it in the Bluetooth device list. Try removing other Bluetooth keyboards from your Mac's Bluetooth settings to avoid conflicts. If problems persist, reset the Bluetooth module: hold Shift+Option and click the Bluetooth menu bar icon, then select "Reset the Bluetooth module."

**Issue: Keys not responding or typing wrong characters**

Solution: Check battery level—low battery can cause erratic behavior. Clean the keyboard with a soft, lint-free cloth. If specific keys aren't working, debris may be under the keycaps—gently blow compressed air under keys. Go to System Settings > Keyboard > Text Input and check that the correct keyboard layout is selected (U.S., UK, etc.). If keys type different characters than labeled, you may have the wrong layout selected. Restart your Mac with the keyboard connected. If certain keys still don't work after cleaning, the keyboard may have a hardware fault—contact Apple Support for warranty service.

**Issue: Bluetooth connection keeps dropping or lagging**

Solution: Ensure the keyboard is within 30 feet of your Mac with no major obstacles. Move the keyboard closer to test if distance is the issue. Check for interference from other Bluetooth devices, Wi-Fi routers, or USB 3.0 devices near your Mac (USB 3.0 can interfere with Bluetooth). Disconnect other Bluetooth devices temporarily to identify conflicts. Charge the keyboard fully—low battery can cause connection instability. On your Mac, go to System Settings > Bluetooth, click the "i" button next to Magic Keyboard, and select "Forget This Device," then repair from scratch. Check for macOS updates (System Settings > General > Software Update) as updates often include Bluetooth improvements.
