## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Position Camera:** Decide where to place the webcam. For monitor mounting, clip it to the top center of your monitor. For laptop use, clip it to the top of your laptop screen. Ensure the lens is at eye level or slightly above for the most flattering angle. The camera should face you directly.

2. **Connect USB Cable:** Plug the USB-A connector into an available USB port on your computer. The camera powers on automatically (LED lights up when active). No drivers needed—Windows and Mac recognize it immediately as "Logitech C920."

3. **Test in Application:** Open your video conferencing app (Zoom, Teams, etc.) or test using the Camera app on Windows or FaceTime on Mac. In the app's video settings, select "Logitech C920" as the camera source and "Logitech C920" as the microphone if you want to use the built-in mics.

4. **Adjust Position and Focus:** Ensure you're centered in the frame. The 78° field of view captures your head and shoulders perfectly from typical desk distance (2-3 feet). Adjust the camera angle by tilting the mount. The autofocus adjusts automatically—wave your hand to see it refocus.

5. **Optimize Lighting (Optional):** For best video quality, face a light source (window or lamp). The RightLight 2 technology helps in poor lighting, but good lighting produces the best results. Download Logitech Capture software (free) to adjust brightness, contrast, and other manual settings if desired.

## Common Questions

**Q: How much better is this than my laptop's built-in webcam?**

A: The improvement is dramatic. Laptop webcams are typically 720p (or worse) with fixed focus, poor low-light performance, and awkward angles. The C920's 1080p resolution is 2x the pixel count, producing sharper, more detailed video. The Carl Zeiss glass lens and autofocus deliver professional-looking results. RightLight 2 technology automatically adjusts to your lighting conditions, while laptop cameras often make you look dark or washed out. The biggest difference is that people on your calls will clearly see your facial expressions and details, making meetings more engaging and professional.

**Q: Do I need to install software or drivers?**

A: No installation needed! The C920 is plug-and-play on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS. Your operating system automatically recognizes it and makes it available to all video applications. The optional Logitech Capture software provides advanced features like custom backgrounds, manual exposure control, and recording, but the camera works perfectly without it. Download Capture only if you want those extra features or want to adjust settings beyond what your video app provides.

**Q: What's the warranty coverage?**

A: This Logitech webcam includes Logitech's 2-year limited hardware warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This covers lens failures, focus mechanism issues, microphone problems, and USB connectivity. Physical damage from drops or misuse is not covered. For warranty service, contact Logitech Support at 1-877-775-6442 or visit support.logitech.com with your proof of purchase.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The webcam must be in good condition with all packaging. Since the C920 is under $500 ($79), there is no restocking fee for returns. Video quality needs are personal, so we provide the 14-day window to test it with your actual lighting conditions and video conferencing setup.

**Q: Should I use the built-in microphones or get a separate mic?**

A: It depends on your needs. The C920's dual microphones are quite good for typical video calls—they have noise reduction and produce clear audio for most situations. For standard work-from-home meetings, they're sufficient. However, if you're doing podcasting, streaming, content creation, or have a noisy environment, a dedicated USB microphone like our Blue Yeti delivers significantly better audio quality. You can use the C920 for video and the Blue Yeti for audio simultaneously—just select C920 as video source and Yeti as audio input in your application settings.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Computer not recognizing webcam or no video in apps**

Solution: Try a different USB port on your computer—preferably one directly on the computer rather than a USB hub. USB hubs sometimes don't provide enough power or bandwidth. On Windows, check Device Manager (right-click Start > Device Manager > Imaging devices or Cameras) to see if C920 appears. On Mac, check System Information (Apple menu > About This Mac > System Report > Camera) to verify detection. In your video app, manually select "Logitech C920" as the video source in settings—it doesn't always default to the external camera. Close all apps that might be using the camera (Zoom, Teams, Skype) and reopen the one you want to use—only one app can access the camera at a time. Restart your computer with the webcam connected. If still not detected, try a different USB cable to rule out cable failure.

**Issue: Video looks blurry, out of focus, or grainy**

Solution: For blurry video, ensure nothing is blocking the lens and that the lens is clean—gently wipe with a soft microfiber cloth. The C920 has autofocus which takes 2-3 seconds to engage when you first connect—wait a moment for it to focus. Wave your hand in front of the camera to trigger a refocus. Ensure you're at an appropriate distance (2-4 feet is ideal)—too close or too far affects focus. For grainy video, improve your lighting—even the best webcams look grainy in very low light. Face a window or add a desk lamp. In your video app, check that resolution is set to 1080p, not 720p or 360p (check video settings). Update the webcam firmware through Logitech Capture software. If video looks blurry on one specific platform but not others, check that platform's video quality settings.

**Issue: Audio echoing, feedback, or people can't hear me clearly**

Solution: Echo occurs when your speakers are too loud and the webcam's microphones pick up the audio from your speakers. Lower your speaker volume or, better yet, use headphones to eliminate echo entirely. If people can't hear you, ensure "Logitech C920" is selected as the microphone in your video app's audio settings—it may default to another mic. Move closer to the webcam (within 3-4 feet) as the microphones are designed for close-range pickup. Reduce background noise—the built-in noise reduction helps but can't eliminate loud sounds. Check your app's audio input level (usually a meter or slider)—adjust if it's too low or maxing out (distorting). On Windows, right-click speaker icon > Sounds > Recording > Logitech C920 > Properties > Levels—adjust microphone level. If audio still has issues, consider using a dedicated USB microphone for better quality.
