## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Attach the Stand:** Place the monitor face-down on a soft surface. Align the stand with the monitor base and secure using the included thumbscrew (no tools required). Carefully lift the monitor upright.

2. **Connect Power:** Plug the power adapter into the monitor and into a wall outlet. The adapter is external (small power brick).

3. **Connect Video Cable:** Use the included HDMI cable to connect from your computer's HDMI port to either HDMI port on the monitor. For MacBooks, first connect a USB-C to HDMI adapter to your laptop, then connect the HDMI cable to the adapter.

4. **Power On:** Press the power button on the bottom-right of the monitor. The display should automatically show your computer's screen. If it doesn't, press the input/source button to select the correct HDMI input.

5. **Adjust Display (Optional):** On Windows, the monitor should run at 1920 x 1080 automatically. On Mac, it usually auto-configures correctly. If text looks too large or small, adjust scaling in display settings. Tilt the monitor to your preferred viewing angle.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this work with my MacBook?**

A: Yes, but you'll need to purchase a USB-C to HDMI adapter separately since MacBooks don't have HDMI ports. We carry affordable USB-C to HDMI adapters ($15-25) that plug into your MacBook's USB-C port, then you connect the monitor's HDMI cable to the adapter. Once connected, the monitor works perfectly with macOS. The monitor doesn't have USB-C input directly, so the adapter is necessary.

**Q: Can I use this for gaming?**

A: This monitor works with game consoles and PC gaming, though it's optimized for everyday use rather than competitive gaming. It has a 75Hz refresh rate and 5ms response time, which is fine for casual gaming. For competitive esports or fast-paced shooters, consider a dedicated gaming monitor with higher refresh rates (144Hz+). For single-player games, work, and general use, this monitor performs well.

**Q: What's the warranty?**

A: This LG monitor includes LG's standard 1-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects and hardware failures. For warranty service, contact LG directly at 1-800-243-0000 or visit lg.com/us/support. Extended warranty options may be available through LG. We can provide your proof of purchase if needed for warranty claims.

**Q: Can I return this after opening it?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The monitor must be in good condition with all accessories. Since this monitor is under $500, there is no restocking fee for returns (restocking fees only apply to items over $500). Simply contact us to start the return process. For defective items, return shipping is free.

**Q: Can I connect two devices at once?**

A: Yes! This monitor has two HDMI ports, so you can connect two devices simultaneously (for example, a laptop and game console). Switch between them using the input/source button on the monitor—you don't need to physically unplug and replug cables. This is convenient for multi-device setups.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: No display or "No Signal" message**

Solution: Check that the monitor is powered on (LED should be lit, typically blue or white when active). Press the input/source button on the monitor to cycle through inputs (HDMI 1, HDMI 2, VGA) until you see your computer's display. Ensure the HDMI cable is firmly connected at both ends. If using an adapter (like USB-C to HDMI for Mac), check that the adapter is fully inserted. Try a different HDMI port on the monitor. On laptops, you may need to press a function key (Fn + F4, F5, or F8 depending on brand) to enable external display. Wake your computer from sleep as some laptops disable display output when sleeping.

**Issue: Display looks fuzzy or blurry**

Solution: Ensure the resolution is set to the monitor's native 1920 x 1080 in your computer's display settings. On Windows: right-click desktop > Display settings > check resolution is 1920 x 1080. On Mac: System Settings > Displays > make sure scaled resolution isn't set to something unusual. If using VGA instead of HDMI, the image will be lower quality—use HDMI for best results. Check that the HDMI cable is fully inserted. Clean the screen gently with a microfiber cloth. If you're sitting very close to the monitor, text may appear pixelated—1080p resolution is best viewed at normal viewing distance (arm's length).

**Issue: Colors look wrong or screen has tint**

Solution: Use the monitor's on-screen display (OSD) menu buttons to reset to factory settings—look for a "Reset" or "Factory Reset" option. Access the OSD by pressing the menu button on the monitor. Try different Picture Mode settings (Standard, Photo, Cinema, etc.)—Standard mode usually has the most accurate colors for work. If using VGA, colors will be less accurate than HDMI due to analog signal—switch to HDMI if possible. Check your computer's display settings to ensure color profile is set correctly. On Mac, go to System Settings > Displays > Color and select a standard sRGB profile. In Windows, right-click desktop > Display settings > Advanced display > Color profile and select sRGB. If the issue persists, try connecting a different device to rule out computer-specific color settings.
