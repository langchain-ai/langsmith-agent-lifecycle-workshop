## Setup & Getting Started

1. **Assemble the Stand:** Connect the stand to the monitor using the quick-release mechanism. No tools required. Adjust height, tilt, and swivel to your ergonomic preference.

2. **Connect Power and Video:** Plug in the power cable. For MacBook users, connect the USB-C cable for single-cable setup (video + charging). For Windows, use DisplayPort for best color performance or HDMI for convenience.

3. **Connect Hotkey Puck:** Plug the Hotkey Puck into one of the monitor's USB ports. This programmable controller lets you quickly switch between color modes and adjust settings without navigating menus.

4. **Select Color Mode:** Press the color mode button on the Hotkey Puck or use the monitor's OSD menu to select your working color space. Choose Adobe RGB for print work, sRGB for web design, or DCI-P3 for video work. The monitor displays which mode is active.

5. **Configure Computer Display Settings:** On macOS, go to System Settings > Displays and ensure color profile matches your selected mode. On Windows, go to Settings > Display > Advanced display > Color profile. For best results, enable color management in your creative applications (Photoshop, Lightroom, etc.) and select the monitor's color profile.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to calibrate this monitor, or is it ready to use?**

A: This monitor comes factory-calibrated with Delta E ≤ 3, which means it's accurate enough for most professional work right out of the box. Each unit includes a calibration report showing its measured color accuracy. For critical color work (commercial printing, client deliverables), you may want to perform hardware calibration using a colorimeter (X-Rite i1Display Pro recommended) via BenQ Palette Master software. This can achieve Delta E ≤ 2. Most photographers and designers find the factory calibration excellent for daily work.

**Q: Will this work with my MacBook for photo editing?**

A: Absolutely! This monitor is an excellent match for MacBooks. Use the included USB-C cable to connect—it carries video signal AND charges your MacBook at 65W simultaneously. The wide Adobe RGB color gamut displays all colors captured by your camera, unlike standard sRGB monitors that can't show the full range. For Lightroom and Photoshop work, this monitor is significantly better than your MacBook's built-in display for final color decisions, especially for print work.

**Q: What's the warranty?**

A: This BenQ monitor includes BenQ's 3-year limited warranty covering defects and hardware failures. BenQ provides advance replacement service for business users. For warranty service, contact BenQ at 1-866-600-2367 or visit benq.com/en-us/support. The warranty includes coverage for dead pixels and uniformity issues that affect professional work.

**Q: Can I return this if opened?**

A: Yes, we accept returns on opened electronics within 14 days of delivery. The monitor must be in good condition with all accessories. Since this monitor is priced over $500 ($599), there's a 15% restocking fee for non-defective returns. Given the professional nature and higher price, we recommend researching whether this monitor fits your workflow before purchasing. If it arrives damaged or has defects, there's no restocking fee.

**Q: What's the difference between Adobe RGB and sRGB?**

A: Adobe RGB is a wider color space that can display about 50% more colors than sRGB, particularly in cyan and green tones. Adobe RGB is used for professional photography and print work because it matches what printers can reproduce. sRGB is the standard for web, phones, and general displays. This monitor can display both—switch to Adobe RGB mode for print work and sRGB mode for web design. If your work goes to print, you need Adobe RGB coverage. If you only work for screen display, sRGB is sufficient (and our other monitors support it).

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Colors don't match what I see on my MacBook/laptop screen**

Solution: This is normal and actually desired behavior—your laptop screen likely uses sRGB color space while this monitor can display wider Adobe RGB. In the monitor's OSD, ensure you're in the correct color mode for your work (Adobe RGB for photography/print, sRGB for web). In your creative applications (Photoshop, Lightroom), ensure color management is enabled and set to the appropriate profile. On macOS, go to System Settings > Displays > Color and select the BenQ color profile. The monitor is more accurate than most laptop displays, so trust the BenQ for final color decisions. If colors still look drastically wrong, try resetting the monitor to factory settings via the OSD menu.

**Issue: Hotkey Puck not responding or not recognized**

Solution: Ensure the Hotkey Puck is connected to one of the monitor's USB downstream ports (not your computer's ports). The monitor's USB hub must be active—connect the included USB Type-B to Type-A cable from the monitor to your computer, or use the USB-C video connection which enables USB functionality automatically. Try a different USB port on the monitor. Download and install the latest BenQ Display Pilot software from benq.com/support to configure Hotkey Puck button assignments. Restart your computer after connecting the puck. If using Windows, check Device Manager to ensure the puck is recognized as a HID device.

**Issue: 10-bit color not working or banding visible in gradients**

Solution: Ensure you're using DisplayPort connection (not HDMI)—DisplayPort supports true 10-bit color, HDMI is limited to 8-bit on this monitor. On Windows, right-click desktop > Display settings > Advanced display > verify output color depth is set to 10-bit. On macOS, 10-bit should work automatically via DisplayPort. In applications like Photoshop, go to Edit > Color Settings and ensure Working Space is set to Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB for wide gamut work. Check that your graphics card supports 10-bit output—professional/workstation GPUs (NVIDIA Quadro, AMD Radeon Pro) have better 10-bit support than gaming cards. If you see banding in test images, your workflow may be 8-bit limited (check file formats—use 16-bit TIFFs for editing).
