# TechHub Product Compatibility Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you understand which TechHub products work together and what adapters or accessories you might need for your setup. We've organized compatibility information by common scenarios to make it easy to build your perfect workspace.

## Mac to PC Product Compatibility

### Products That Work Seamlessly on Both Mac and PC

**Monitors (All):**
- Dell UltraSharp 27" 4K, LG 24" 1080p, Samsung 32" Curved Gaming, BenQ 27" Designer Monitor
- All monitors work with both platforms via HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C connections
- Note: MacBooks need USB-C to HDMI adapters for monitors without USB-C input (LG 24", Samsung Gaming Monitor)

**Cross-Platform Keyboards:**
- Logitech MX Keys: Designed for multi-platform use, switches between Mac/Windows/iPad seamlessly with correct key mappings for each OS
- Mechanical Gaming Keyboard: Works on Mac but software is Windows-only; macOS treats it as standard keyboard

**Cross-Platform Mice:**
- Logitech MX Master 3S: Excellent Mac and Windows support with automatic key mapping per OS, supports 3-device switching
- Wireless Mouse & Keyboard Combo: Works on both but Windows-optimized; Mac compatibility is basic

### Products Designed Exclusively for Mac

**Mac-Only Peripherals:**
- Apple Magic Keyboard: Technically works on Windows via Bluetooth but loses most functionality; not recommended
- Apple Magic Mouse: Works on Windows but gestures don't function and scrolling feels awkward; Mac-only recommended

### Products That Require Adapters for Mac

**Monitors Without USB-C:**
- LG 24" 1080p Monitor (HDMI only) → Requires USB-C to HDMI adapter for MacBooks
- Samsung 32" Curved Gaming Monitor (HDMI/DisplayPort) → Requires USB-C to HDMI adapter for MacBooks
- Adapter needed: USB-C to HDMI ($15-25) or use our USB-C Hub with built-in HDMI

**Peripherals with USB-A:**
- Wireless Mouse & Keyboard Combo (USB-A receiver) → May need USB-C to USB-A adapter for newer MacBooks
- Blue Yeti Microphone (USB-A) → May need USB-C to USB-A adapter or hub for newer MacBooks
- Logitech C920 Webcam (USB-A) → May need USB-C to USB-A adapter or hub for newer MacBooks

## Monitor Connection Guide

### Connecting Monitors to MacBooks

- Use USB-C to USB-C cable for Dell UltraSharp or BenQ Designer Monitor (both have USB-C input)

- Direct USB-C/Thunderbolt connection to USB-C monitors

### Connecting Monitors to Windows Laptops

**Dell XPS 13:**
- Supports up to 2 external 4K displays
- Has 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports + 1 USB-C port

### Monitor Resolution and Refresh Rate by Connection

- Supports 4K @ 60Hz
- Supports 1440p @ 144Hz (Samsung Gaming Monitor)
- Supports 1080p @ 75Hz (LG 24" Monitor)

**DisplayPort 1.4 (Dell UltraSharp, BenQ Designer):**

- Preferred for color-critical work
- Use DisplayPort when available for best quality

**USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode:**

## USB-C and Thunderbolt Explained

### What's the Difference?

**USB-C (Physical Connector):**
- The physical port shape—oval, reversible connector
- Can carry USB data, video (DisplayPort), and power
- Not all USB-C ports support all features—check your laptop specs

**Thunderbolt 3/4 (Protocol):**
- High-speed data protocol that uses USB-C connector
- All Thunderbolt ports support USB-C devices (backward compatible)
- Provides 40 Gbps bandwidth (vs USB-C's 5-20 Gbps)
- All MacBooks with USB-C have Thunderbolt 3 or 4

### What This Means for TechHub Products

**Our USB-C Hub:**
- Works with any USB-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode (video output)
- All Thunderbolt ports support this → Hub works with all MacBooks
- Most modern Windows laptops support this → Check if your specific USB-C port supports video

**Video Output:**
- If your laptop has Thunderbolt → Video output supported via our hub or direct connection
- If your laptop has USB-C → Check specs for "DisplayPort Alt Mode" or "video output support"
- If unsure → Test with monitor or use built-in HDMI port on Windows laptops
