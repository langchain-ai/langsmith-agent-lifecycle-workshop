# Customer Support FAQ

Quick answers to the most common questions about orders, accounts, payments, and more.

## Order Tracking & Status

**How do I track my order?**
Use the tracking link in your shipping confirmation email, or log into your account and visit "My Orders." You can also track directly on the carrier website (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) using your tracking number.

**When will I receive my tracking number?**
You'll receive a shipping confirmation email with your tracking number within 1-2 business days after placing your order. If you placed your order before 2 PM ET on a weekday, it typically ships the same day.

**My tracking hasn't updated in days. What should I do?**
Tracking information updates every 4-6 hours. If there's no update for more than 24 hours, contact the carrier directly using your tracking number. They have the most current information about your package location.

## Modifying or Canceling Orders

**Can I cancel my order?**
If your order hasn't shipped yet, contact us immediately and we can cancel it for a full refund. Once an order ships, you'll need to receive it and follow our return process. Check your order status in your account or by contacting support.

**Can I change my shipping address?**
If your order hasn't shipped, contact us right away and we'll update the address. Once shipped, address changes must go through the carrier and may incur additional fees. Make sure to double-check your address at checkout to avoid issues.

**Can I add items to an existing order?**
Unfortunately, we can't modify orders after they're placed. You'll need to place a separate order for additional items. If both orders total over $50, both qualify for free standard shipping.

## Account Management

**How do I reset my password?**
Click "Forgot Password" on the login page and enter your email address. You'll receive a password reset link within a few minutes. Check your spam folder if you don't see it.

**How do I update my email or shipping address?**
Log into your account and go to Account Settings. You can update your email, password, default shipping address, and communication preferences there.

**Do I need an account to place an order?**
No, you can checkout as a guest. However, having an account makes it easier to track orders, manage returns, and checkout faster on future purchases.

**Can I merge two accounts?**
Yes! If you accidentally created duplicate accounts, contact our support team and we'll merge them for you, combining your order history into one account.

## Payment & Pricing

**What payment methods do you accept?**
We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, PayPal, and Apple Pay. All transactions are processed securely with industry-standard encryption.

**Do you offer price matching?**
Yes! If you purchase an item and it goes on sale within 14 days, contact us for a price adjustment. We'll refund the difference to your original payment method.

**Can I use multiple payment methods on one order?**
Currently, we only accept one payment method per order. You cannot split payment between multiple cards or combine payment methods.

**Why was my card declined?**
Common reasons include insufficient funds, incorrect billing address, or security holds from your bank. Verify your information is correct and contact your bank if the issue persists. They may need to approve the transaction.

**When will I be charged?**
Your payment method is authorized when you place the order and charged when the order ships (typically within 1-2 business days).

**How do I use a promo code?**
Enter your promo code in the designated field during checkout before completing your purchase. The discount will be applied to your order total. Promo codes cannot be applied after an order is placed.

## Security & Privacy

**How do you protect my information?**
We use industry-standard SSL encryption for all transactions. We never store full credit card numbers (only the last 4 digits for reference). Your personal information is never sold to third parties.

**I received a suspicious email asking for my password. Is it from you?**
No! We will NEVER ask for your password via email. If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from TechHub, forward it to security@techhub.com and delete it. Do not click any links or provide any information.

**How do I enable two-factor authentication?**
Two-factor authentication is available in your Account Settings under Security. We highly recommend enabling it for additional account protection, especially if you store payment information.

## Returns & Refunds

**What's your return policy?**
Opened electronics can be returned within 14 days of delivery, unopened items within 30 days. See our [Return Policy](return_policy.md) for complete details including restocking fees and conditions.

**How long do refunds take?**
Once we receive and process your return, refunds are issued within 5-7 business days to your original payment method. It may take an additional 3-7 business days for your bank to post the credit to your account.

## Common Issues

**Order confirmation email not received**
Check your spam/junk folder first. If it's not there, verify the email address on your account is correct. Contact support and we can resend the confirmation.

**Promo code not working**
Verify the code hasn't expired and your order meets any minimum purchase requirements. Some codes are product-specific or can't be combined with sale items. Contact support if you need help.

**Received wrong item**
We apologize for the error! Contact us immediately with your order number and photos of what you received. We'll ship the correct item right away and provide a prepaid return label for the incorrect item.

**Item arrived damaged**
Contact us within 48 hours of delivery with photos of the damage. We'll arrange for a replacement or full refund and provide a prepaid return label. You won't be charged for return shipping on damaged items.
