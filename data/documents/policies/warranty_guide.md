# Warranty Guide

All products purchased from TechHub include manufacturer warranty coverage. This guide explains what's covered, what's not, and how to file a warranty claim.

## Standard Warranty Coverage

**All Products Include:**
- 1-year limited manufacturer warranty
- Coverage begins on the delivery date
- Covers manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship
- Hardware component failures under normal use conditions

**What This Means:**
Your product is guaranteed to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for one year from the date of delivery. If a covered issue occurs during this period, the manufacturer will repair or replace the product at no charge.

## What's Covered

The manufacturer warranty covers:

- **Manufacturing Defects:** Flaws in materials or assembly that existed at the time of manufacture
- **Hardware Failures:** Component failures during normal use (e.g., screen defects, keyboard malfunctions, battery issues)
- **Dead on Arrival (DOA):** Products that don't work right out of the box
- **Premature Wear:** Failures that occur much earlier than expected under normal use

## What's NOT Covered

The warranty does not cover:

- **Accidental Damage:** Drops, impacts, spills, or crushing damage
- **Water Damage:** Liquid exposure or moisture damage (even for products with some water resistance)
- **Cosmetic Damage:** Scratches, dents, or wear that doesn't affect functionality
- **Unauthorized Repairs:** Damage caused by non-authorized service or modifications
- **Normal Wear and Tear:** Battery capacity reduction, keyboard shine, mouse feet wear
- **Lost or Stolen Items:** Coverage ends if the product is lost or stolen
- **Software Issues:** Software problems not related to hardware defects
- **Damage from Misuse:** Using the product in ways not intended by the manufacturer

## Filing a Warranty Claim

If you experience a warranty-eligible issue, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Contact the Manufacturer**

- Contact information is in your product documentation or on the manufacturer's website

**Step 2: Manufacturer Assessment**
- The manufacturer will troubleshoot the issue with you
- They may request photos or diagnostic information
- If warranty service is approved, they'll provide a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number

**Step 3: Ship the Product**
- Follow the manufacturer's shipping instructions
- They typically provide a prepaid shipping label for warranty returns
- Pack the product securely

**Step 4: Repair or Replacement**
- The manufacturer will repair or replace your product
- Turnaround time is typically 1-3 weeks
- You'll receive tracking information when your product ships back

## Warranty vs. Return Policy

It's important to understand the difference:

**Return Policy (14-30 days):**
- For any reason, including buyer's remorse
- Handled through TechHub
- Fast resolution (refund within 5-7 business days)
- May include restocking fee for opened items over $500

**Warranty (1 year+):**
- For defects and hardware failures only
- Handled by the manufacturer
- Longer turnaround time (1-3 weeks)
- No cost for covered issues

**Our Recommendation:** If you're having issues within the first 14 days and are considering returning the product anyway, the return process may be faster than waiting for warranty service.
