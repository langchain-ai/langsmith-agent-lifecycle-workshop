    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph Primitives Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **StateGraph** - Custom state schema with domain-specific fields\n",
    "   - `messages`: Shared with supervisor subgraph (uses `add_messages` reducer)\n",
    "   - `customer_id`: Verification status\n",
    "   - `verification_attempts`: Retry logic control\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes** - Modular functions that operate on state\n",
    "   - `query_router`: Routes based on verification needs (checks state + classifies query)\n",
    "   - `verify_customer`: Uses LLM to conversationally collect & validate email\n",
    "   - `collect_email`: Dedicated HITL node with `interrupt()`\n",
    "   - `supervisor_agent`: Subgraph node (compiled graph from Section 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditional Edges** - Dynamic routing based on state\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def should_continue_verification(state):\n",
    "       if state.get(\"customer_id\"):\n",
    "           return \"supervisor_agent\"  # Verified!\n",
    "       return \"collect_email\"  # Need more input\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **interrupt()** - Pause execution for human input\n",
    "   - Best practice: Use dedicated node for `interrupt()`\n",
    "   - Separate HITL logic from business logic\n",
    "   - Requires checkpointer to work\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Checkpointer** - State persistence across turns\n",
    "   - Required for `interrupt()` to work\n",
    "   - Enables conversation memory\n",
    "   - Automatically propagated to subgraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Subgraphs** - Compose graphs as nodes\n",
    "   - Reuse Section 3's supervisor as a node\n",
    "   - Shared state keys (`messages`)\n",
    "   - Clean separation of concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use What\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Use When... |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **`create_agent`** | Simple agents, standard tool loops, straightforward routing |\n",
    "| **LangGraph StateGraph** | Conditional HITL, custom state, complex orchestration, retry loops |\n",
    "| **Hybrid (this section!)** | Keep agents simple, add sophisticated orchestration layer |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification Loop Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Our two-node pattern demonstrates best practices for conversational HITL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Node 1: Business logic (extract & validate)\n",
    "def verify_customer(state):\n",
    "    extraction = llm.with_structured_output(...).invoke(state[\"messages\"])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if extraction[\"email\"]:\n",
    "        customer = validate_customer_email(extraction[\"email\"])\n",
    "        if customer:\n",
    "            return {\"customer_id\": customer.customer_id}  # Success!\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            # Generate helpful error via LLM\n",
    "            return {\"messages\": [llm_error_response]}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # No email detected - ask for it\n",
    "    return {\"messages\": [llm_request_email]}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Node 2: Human input (HITL)\n",
    "def collect_email(state):\n",
    "    user_input = interrupt(\"Please provide your email:\")\n",
    "    return {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=user_input)]}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conditional edge: Route based on verification status\n",
    "def should_continue_verification(state):\n",
    "    return \"supervisor_agent\" if state.get(\"customer_id\") else \"collect_email\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow:**\n",
    "1. `verify_customer` → asks for email (if needed) → `collect_email` (interrupt)\n",
    "2. Resume → `verify_customer` → validates email → `supervisor_agent` (success) OR `collect_email` (retry)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- All messages saved to state (full conversation history)\n",
    "- LLM generates natural, context-aware prompts\n",
    "- Explicit `collect_email` node = clear graph visualization\n",
    "- Separation of concerns: validation vs. collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Separation of Concerns:**\n",
    "- Verification layer: Handles HITL and customer identity\n",
    "- Supervisor: Routes to appropriate specialists\n",
    "- Sub-agents: Execute specific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Reusability:**\n",
    "- Section 3's supervisor agent works unchanged\n",
    "- Sub-agents remain simple with `create_agent`\n",
    "- Verification logic isolated in LangGraph layer\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Maintainability:**\n",
    "- Update verification rules without touching supervisor\n",
    "- Change max retry attempts in one place\n",
    "- Clear flow visible in graph structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module 1 Complete! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now built:\n",
    "1. **Section 1:** Manual tool calling (foundation)\n",
    "2. **Section 2:** `create_agent` abstraction (simplification)\n",
    "3. **Section 3:** Multi-agent with supervisor (specialization)\n",
    "4. **Section 4:** LangGraph primitives + HITL (sophistication) ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- **Module 2:** Evaluate this system to find weaknesses\n",
    "- **Module 3:** Deploy to production with LangGraph Cloud\n",
