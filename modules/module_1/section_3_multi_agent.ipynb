    "\n",
    "1. **Documents are split into chunks** (~1000 characters)\n",
    "2. **Chunks become vectors (embeddings)** that capture meaning\n",

    "**Our Setup:**\n",
    "- **25 product docs + 5 policy docs** → **337 chunks**\n",
    "- **HuggingFace embeddings** (local, no API key needed)\n",
    "- **Metadata filtering** separates products from policies\n",
    "- **Pre-built vectorstore** loaded from `data/vector_stores/`\n",

    "## 📦 Code Refactoring Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents we built in this section (Database Agent, Documents Agent, and Supervisor) have been **refactored into the `agents/` directory** as reusable factory functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `agents/db_agent.py` - Database Agent factory\n",
    "- `agents/docs_agent.py` - Documents Agent factory\n",
    "- `agents/supervisor_agent.py` - Supervisor Agent factory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why factory functions?**\n",
    "- Fresh checkpointer for each instantiation (no state pollution)\n",
    "- Clean imports and reusability across notebooks\n",
    "- Standard LangChain pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 4**, we'll import these agents rather than redefining them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from agents import create_db_agent, create_docs_agent, create_supervisor_agent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how to architect production-ready, reusable code! 🏗️"

   "source": [
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialized Sub-Agents**\n",
    "   - Database Agent: Expert at structured data queries\n",
    "   - Documents Agent: Expert at document search\n",
    "   - Each agent has focused tools and expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supervisor Pattern**\n",
    "   - Sub-agents wrapped as tools (`@tool` decorator)\n",
    "   - Supervisor routes queries to appropriate specialist(s)\n",
    "   - Can orchestrate **parallel** or **sequential** coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordination Patterns**\n",
    "   - **Simple routing**: Single agent handles entire query\n",
    "   - **Parallel coordination**: Multiple agents work independently on different parts\n",
    "   - **Sequential coordination**: Output from one agent feeds into another (true orchestration!)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits of Multi-Agent Architecture**\n",
    "   - **Separation of concerns** - Each agent has clear responsibility\n",
    "   - **Easier debugging** - Traces show which agent handled what\n",
    "   - **Maintainability** - Update one agent without affecting others\n",
    "   - **Scalability** - Easy to add new specialist agents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Viewing Traces in LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to your LangSmith project to see:\n",
    "- **Routing decisions** - Which agent(s) the supervisor called\n",
    "- **Tool executions** - What tools each agent used\n",
    "- **Message flow** - Complete conversation tree\n",
    "- **Timing** - How long each step took\n",
    "- **Sequential dependencies** - See when agents must run in order\n",
    "\n",
    "This visibility makes multi-agent systems much easier to debug!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's Next: Section 4 (Advanced Track)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 4**, we'll use **LangGraph primitives** to build even more sophisticated workflows:\n",
    "- Custom state management beyond messages\n",
    "- Conditional routing based on state\n",
    "- `interrupt()` for Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "- Customer verification workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key decision point:**\n",
    "- Use `create_agent` for standard agent workflows ✅\n",
    "- Use LangGraph primitives for complex orchestration needs ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looking Ahead to Module 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we're still limited by having only specific, pre-defined tools:\n",
    "- Can't answer: \"What products has customer CUST-001 bought?\" (need SQL JOINs)\n",
    "- Can't answer: \"Show me all orders over $500\" (need flexible queries)\n",
    "- Can't answer: \"Which customers bought MacBooks?\" (need complex SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 2**, we'll upgrade the Database Agent to a **SQL Generation Agent** that can:\n",
    "- Generate dynamic SQL queries for ANY question\n",
    "- Handle complex JOINs and aggregations\n",
    "- Dramatically expand system capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets up a clear pedagogical win: Module 1 teaches multi-agent patterns, Module 2 shows how to make agents more powerful! 🚀"
